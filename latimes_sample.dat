NEW FALLOUT FROM CHERNOBYL; 
</P>
<P>
THE SOCIAL IMPACT OF THE CHERNOBYL DISASTER BY DAVID R. MARPLES (ST.
MARTIN'S 
PRESS: $35, CLOTH; $14.95, PAPER; 316 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-312-02432-0)

By James E. Oberg , Oberg, a space engineer in Houston, is the author of 
Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost (Random
House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly
mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has
complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new
Western 
insights into Soviet society. David R. Marples' new book, his second on
the 
Chernobyl accident of April 26, 1986, is a shining example of the best
type of 
non-Soviet analysis into topics that only recently were absolutely taboo
in 
Moscow official circles. 
</P>
<P>
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research
associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of
Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised. However, its intended 
audience is the general public, and anyone interested in nuclear power,
or 
Soviet economy and society, or human drama, or just plain sleuthing
state 
secrets, will find hitherto unpublished revelations and explanations of
the 
event and its continuing aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
The effects of Chernobyl reverberated throughout so many facets of
Soviet 
society that a continuous coherent narrative is probably impossible.
Marples 
discusses half a dozen major themes arranged in a fairly arbitrary order
(as 
indicated by the frequent and helpful cross references throughout the
text) and 
succeeds in mapping out his main themes. The personal interests of each
reader 
determine which of the sections may be deemed too detailed and which too 
sketchy, but considering the need for such a comprehensive overview, the
levels 
are generally appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
The book is, on the one hand, not a light read, and an executive summary
might 
have been possible in a quarter the length. But, on the other, so many
of the 
judgments depend on a subtle interpretation of a multitude of sources
that the 
author is obligated to present the raw data for the reader's inspection.
The 
modular nature of the book also allows a reader to skip, browse, and
revisit 
earlier sections, aided by a convenient internal organization and a
thorough 
index. 
</P>
<P>
First in the world's attention, and in the text, is a discussion of the
human 
victims of the accident. The official tally is 31 (only about 20 names
have 
ever been released), but Marples suspects there were other short-term
radiation 
victims. A large number of unnecessary late-term abortions were also
performed 
on local women, and by rights those unborn babies count as casualties. 
Widespread "radiophobia" led to restricted diets which created
malnourishment 
and subsequent disease in thousands of people. The tens of thousands of
people 
taking part in cleanup operations were never included in official totals
of 
those exposed. Since the book went to press, Soviet military sources
have 
referred to at least one death in the actual reactor entombment program. 
</P>
<P>
But the greatest toll is likely to occur with the delayed deaths. Here,
Marples 
encounters for the first time the soon familiar theme of official Soviet 
myth-making around the event: Reality is twisted to serve state policy 
objectives, which include calming an alarmed public with assurances that
all is 
well when it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
And thus is born what he properly labels the "myth of Chernobyl," the
official 
line that the disaster provided a test that Soviet society passed with
honor. 
"In the Soviet view," he writes, "it was first and foremost a victory, a
story 
with an ending, and an ending that was triumphant." 
</P>
<P>
Thus, when sober Western medical estimates placed the future "excess
cancer 
deaths" at several tens of thousands, both in the Soviet Union and in
Europe (a 
few tenths of a percent elevation of the natural cancer rate), the
Soviets 
reacted furiously. The estimates are branded "nonsense" and the
estimators are 
dismissed as "panic mongers" promulgating "anti-Soviet venom." 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently the author addresses themes of environmental impact,
economic and 
political repercussions, public images, and the recovery operations.
Along the 
way, Marples provides a damning list of examples in which Soviet
officials 
attempted to retreat behind old-style cover-ups and outright lies. False 
information was issued on radiation levels, on subsequent accidents at
the 
site, on contamination levels of the Kiev water supply, on severe
discipline 
against non-volunteer cleanup personnel, on reactor entombment schedules
and on 
operator training levels. 
</P>
<P>
A severe 1986-1987 countrywide electrical power shortage was officially
denied 
although it was real enough to compel the restart of three Chernobyl
reactors 
in explicit violation of Soviet safety regulations. Design deficiencies
of the 
Chernobyl-style reactors were downplayed and human errors were declared
to be 
the primary culprit. 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, observes the author, "It is ironic that in an era of
openness, 
Chernobyl may have been both the pioneer of glasnost under Gorbachev and
then 
subsequently its first casualty." He ultimately concludes, "Aspects of
the 
disaster . . . have rarely been dealt with thoroughly or even honestly
by 
Soviet sources." Hence the need for this book, a need which is admirably 
fulfilled despite the many remaining mysteries and uncertainties. 
</P>
<P>
The July, 1987, trial of reactor personnel marked a full circle of
disclosure. 
Journalists were allowed into the pre-scripted first and last days, but
the 
weeklong deliberative sessions were held in secret and no word of their 
substance has ever been released. 
</P>
<P>
The propaganda purpose of the trial and surrounding official publicity,
he 
maintains, had one goal: "To divert culpability from the party
hierarchy, in 
Kiev and especially in Moscow." This is precisely the theme I have also 
encountered in my own investigations of aerospace accidents of the past.
Where 
individual human failings led to catastrophe, a sanitized story may
eventually 
be released, but where Kremlin policy led to disaster (such as the
Nedelin 
catastrophe of 1960 or the Soyuz-1 disaster in 1967), the entire event
remains 
absolutely off limits to glasnost. 
</P>
<P>
The closing blow-by-blow description of the nuclear power debate
presages a 
dramatic event which occurred too recently for inclusion in this first
edition. 
Viktor Legasov, tagged by the author as one of the country's two leading 
pro-nuclear advocates, actually was sinking into private despair over
the poor 
implementation of safety standards. In the end, he made his final and
most 
eloquent testimony to this despair on the second anniversary of the
accident, 
by committing suicide. For several weeks the Soviets tried to sit on the 
circumstances of his "tragic death," even issuing official
non-explanations 
which asserted that the death was not due to medical effects of
radiation. 
Finally, crusading journalist Vladimir Gubarev, with access to Legasov's 
notebooks, broke the story in Pravda. Readers of this book will come to
know 
these and other characters so well that the suicide fits right into the
"big 
picture" of the catastrophe's social impacts. 
</P>
<P>
For an author to so accurately describe a social milieu that subsequent 
unpredictable events only enhance his insights is testimony to the
highest 
quality of scholarship. Readers of Marples' book will rarely be
surprised as 
the Chernobyl catastrophe's consequences continue to unfold in the
future.

<P>
TOCQUEVILLE A BIOGRAPHY BY ANDRE JARDIN; TRANSLATED BY LYDIA DAVIS WITH
ROBERT 
HEMENWAY(FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; GIROUX: $30; 548 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Annette J. Smith and David R. Smith , Both Smiths are professors at
Caltech 
and co-translators and editors of 'Mademoiselle Irnois' and Other
Stories by 
Arthur de Gobineau (University of California Press), who was, among
other 
things, Tocqueville's secretary. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Andre Jardin's "Tocqueville," surprisingly the first full-scale
biography of 
this major 19th-Century figure, is a fine, old-fashioned piece of work,
some of 
it original, much of it taken from the ample precedent scholarship. It
provides 
an abundant store of information and an occasional surprise -- a dozen
years 
after its publication, we find the author of "Democracy in America," now 
minister of foreign affairs, exclaiming: "But what animals these
Americans 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
It is as the author of "Democracy in America" that Tocqueville is known
in this 
country; but what this biography reveals is not so much an admirer of
America 
as a Frenchman of his time, circumstance and needs, even when he is in
America. 
He came here with his friend Beaumont ostensibly as a student of
penitentiary 
reform, but Tocqueville really wanted to take a larger look at this new 
republic, since it was clear to him that the European drift was in that 
direction, and what intrigued him was its democratic base, since he had
been 
brought up to believe that a republic could function only when run by a 
virtuous elite. We know what he found and how he responded, but the
biography 
also reveals, almost inadvertently, why he was such an accurate and 
comparatively unbiased observer. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he had not biased himself by reading contemporary travel 
literature, much of it written by snide Tories pretending to take an 
unprejudiced look at the American experiment. Capt. Basil Hall's
infamous 
"Travels" had been only partially translated (the chapter on prison
reform) 
into French, and, in any event, it was his companion Beaumont who read
it. The 
result was that Tocqueville's vision had not been prejudiced (other than
by his 
relative Chateaubriand's romance with New World nature). For another, 
Tocqueville and Beaumont readied themselves each day by preparing
questions for 
the people they would meet, questions based upon their own observations
sur 
place and designed to elicit responses useful to them as Frenchmen
trying to 
prepare themselves for a possible future. They were not, as were the
Tories, 
justifying a past. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's Cartesian clarity, his relative lack of bias, meant that
he used 
the answers to his questions to form a useful statement about America,
but the 
questions themselves and their reasons reveal perhaps even more about
France. 
By looking at this intelligent, open-minded, and inquiring young civil
servant 
and nobleman of impeccable political parentage (great grandson of
Malesherbes), 
Jardin's book provides the American reader a marvelous introduction to
the 
political shiftings, the gradual yet sometimes violent
post-revolutionary 
cracking of the political structure in France as it grappled
simultaneously 
with the shattered legitimacy of the past, a slippery present and an 
ill-defined future. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate success of "Democracy in America" (1835),
Tocqueville 
entered the political arena and was elected deputy for the
arrondissement of 
Valognes, the region of his family castle in Normandy. He sat left of
center in 
the Chamber. Although many at the time thought of him as an Carlist
aristocrat 
and some in this country think of him as an American-style conservative, 
Tocqueville considered the old aristocracy "dead for ever." Over the
years, he 
demonstrated his liberalism by fighting for parliamentary monarchy,
separation 
of church and state, reform of the suffrage laws, improvement of the
worker's 
lot, for liberalizing public education, abolishing slavery wherever it
existed, 
improving the prison system and eliminating poverty. He managed,
nevertheless, 
to stay clear of several more powerful champions of liberal causes such
as 
Lamartine, Royer-Collard, and Thiers, who would have liked to have him
on their 
side but whose egos he mistrusted. 
</P>
<P>
Independence is what most characterizes Tocqueville's career. A
colleague 
reproached him for "giving the right hand to the left, the left to the
right 
and regretting that he does not have a third one to give invisibly."
"Freedom 
is the strongest of my passions. Voila. It is the truth," he explained
to 
disconcerted observers. If he moved left, it was, he claimed, to impose
his 
color on the left, not change his own. 
</P>
<P>
Another constant was his hatred of centralization. In "L'Ancien Regime
et la 
Revolution," Tocqueville analyzed the roots of centralization in France,
which 
according to him went as far back as the reign of Philip the Fair in the
Middle 
Ages. He lamented the fact that centralization had destroyed time-tested
local 
organic structures and that the French nobility itself was at fault in
the 
process. Tocqueville fought centralism in all of its manifestations as
he saw 
them. For instance, rather an agnostic himself, he defended religious
education 
because he believed in the healthy necessity of a third force besides
the state 
and the people. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville's anticentralism colored his responses to the various
colonial 
enterprises that characterize European history of the period. Thus, in
newly 
conquered Algeria, he favored a kind of settlement based on local
autonomy 
rather than central metropolitan power. He was the first man in the
Chamber to 
push for a separate ministry for Algeria -- a dream that became a fact
only a 
century later in Leon Blum's cabinet. He deplored the downfall of the
Ottoman 
Empire in the Middle East, since the Turks were not only a desirable
bumper 
between the major European predators, but also relatively tolerant
themselves 
toward the diversity of their possessions. He admired the respect for
local 
customs that the British had shown in India. 
</P>
<P>
Tocqueville was an active, intelligent legislator, esteemed particularly
for 
his work on penitentiary reform (inspired by the Philadelphia system)
and on 
the abolition of slavery, but he was not a sensational figurehead. One
might 
say that, like Montaigne, he had lived through a great deal of political 
turmoil and managed to preserve an independent judgment. When
Louis-Napoleon 
was propelled into the presidency at the end of the bloody 1848
revolution, 
Tocqueville was given the foreign affairs ministry in the Barrot
cabinet. He 
served with the same unsensational distinction as in the Chamber but was
fired 
after only five months. He had protested Louis-Napoleon's coup d'etat
that made 
an emperor of the president and was briefly imprisoned in Vincennes --
luckier 
in this than one of our great-grandfathers, who was sent to the Sahara
for the 
same offense. From then to his death from tuberculosis in Cannes in
1859, 
Tocqueville led the life of a gentleman farmer and journalist who, amid 
numerous changes of residence to accommodate his health, wrote (but did
not 
finish) "L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution." 
</P>
<P>
This long and scrupulous study of a man who was one of the most profound
and 
prophetic thinkers of his time, is, alas, scrupulous to the point of
boredom. 
The narration rarely deviates from an inexhaustible concatenation of
facts 
related in the soberest of prose. Although it does justice to
Tocqueville's 
ideas, it fails in rendering the passion and the grace of his
intellectual life 
and the social brilliance of the era. Moreover, the book is curiously 
organized: The order followed a mixture of the chronological and of the 
thematic, with several baffling leaps from one to the other. Andre
Jardin's 
work constitutes an excellent work of reference for the scholar. It is
indexed 
and substantially but not cumbersomely footnoted. Still it makes the
layman 
yearn for the livelier manner of much recent historical writing.

TUNGSTEN A NOVEL BY CESAR VALLEJO; TRANSLATED BY ROBERT MEZEY; FOREWORD
BY 
KEVIN J. O'CONNOR (SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY PRESS: $19.95; 168 PP.;

By Edith Grossman, Grossman is a critic and translator of Latin American 
literature. She teaches at Dominican College in New York State, is the
author 
of The Antipoetry of Nicanor Parra and recently translated Gabriel
Garcia 
Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in
which evil 
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack
dimension 
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of
the 
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and
why 
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the
author is 
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major
figure in 
Latin American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically
altered 
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend
setter, 
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral
compassion 
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and 
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife
thrusts. A 
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and
despaired 
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was
living in 
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the
roots 
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics. 
</P>
<P>
Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the
victimization 
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family
was not 
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in
the 
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of
mixed 
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society
where 
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic
certainty, where 
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely
acknowledged in 
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted 
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the
near-slavery 
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of
that 
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en
masse of 
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned
masters 
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor
in mines 
and on plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have
denounced the 
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest
novels to 
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest
energies 
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros,"
his 
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the
periphery of 
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South
America 
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and
place 
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and
workers 
began its inexorable march toward Marxism. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru
takes its 
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of
the 
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American
Alliance") 
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an
intermittent 
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his 
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then
his 
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work
in the 
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the 
Chicama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw 
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry
against 
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would
take 
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from
the 
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment
to 
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion
from 
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its 
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry
into 
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the
weapons 
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom
is on: 
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company,
local 
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit
bourgeois 
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position,
and 
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and 
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the
book, 
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of
vignettes 
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the
violent 
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero,
Servando 
Huanca. 
</P>
<P>
Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the
military as 
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits
or 
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from
their 
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their
captors 
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside
the 
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of
the 
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps
forward to 
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class 
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow
the 
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and
later 
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can
find, 
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are
struck 
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure
death in 
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota." 
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of
postscript 
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to
turn into 
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief
exercise 
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it
will be 
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois 
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru.
Vallejo 
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: 
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword,
Robert 
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish,
and 
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in
bringing 
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry
that I 
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are
frequent and 
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has
provided 
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader;
Vallejo 
and his translator deserve better.

<TEXT>
<P>
The four tribes of the now-extinct native Americans that once inhabited
the 
Tierra del Fuego archipelago -- that ships' graveyard along the land's
end, 
southern tip of South America -- were among the most primitive and hardy 
peoples encountered in the New World. In this fine piece of historical
fiction 
cum-exemplary story, French novelist Jean Raspail explores the sad fate
of the 
Alacalufs (who called themselves Kaweskar, "The People"), the lesser
known of 
the two tribes of sea-nomads or "canoe Indians." 
</P>
<P>
Raspail reconstructs the history of the Alacalufs through their own eyes
and 
those of Magellan, Drake and other historical figures. In this noble
quest of 
the "other" (those whose languages and customs seemed so alien to
Europeans 
that they refused to admit that they belonged to the human species), the
view 
from "within" is attempted through a synopsis of generations, of
millennia, in 
the mind of the character Lafko, a kind of collective memory of the
Alacalufs. 
The view from "without" reveals a shameful history of smug disdain: From 
Magellan on, Europeans judged the Alacalufs to be "ugly," "stinking," 
"disgusting," "brutish," "beasts," "animals"; they kidnaped them,
enslaved them 
and, at worst, their genocidal instincts unleashed, they turned their
guns and 
cannons on them for sport, exterminated them; in the end, they were
hunted for 
bounty or herded into missionary stations where they died of white man's 
diseases or the despair of captivity, and the last stragglers were
reduced to 
bartering and begging in the shipping lanes of the Strait of Magellan.
The 
complicity of scientists (like Darwin) in fostering this outcome is
addressed 
in a couple of the chapters. 
</P>
<P>
The other side of the coin -- that our survival, too, depends on our
ability to 
embrace others not as a function of our own ideal but of theirs -- is
seen in 
the tragic fate of the inhabitants of Name of Jesus and the City of King 
Philip, Spain's first settlement communities in Tierra del Fuego,who
went mad 
or starved to death. The English privateer Cavendish rechristened the
latter 
city Port Famine. 
</P>
<P>
The point is brought home in the moving chapter, "A Civilized
Gentleman." Sir 
John Byron, shipwrecked in the Strait in his youth and rescued by the 
Alacalufs, returns to the scene years later and ponders the legacy of
European 
contacts: "What an endless history of contempt is unraveled! And yet . .
. ." 
An instinct for survival had not saved his fellow castaways. He alone
had 
survived by crossing the cultural abyss and living with the Alacaluf
clan for 
six months, and the clan had braved the seas and their fears of the
world 
beyond their territory to set him down on an island from which Chilotan
seal 
hunters returned him to Puerto Montt. 
</P>
<P>
But when Raspail attempts to give us a glimpse from within (the inner
life of 
the Alacalufs), the reader is aware of a European mind wedged between
him and 
the "other." The Alacalufs are "endlessly fleeing," "forsaken" pariahs, 
"commanded by fate to survive, not to live" in a land shrouded in "an
eternally 
black sky," "a witches' dance of cruel winds," "a hell of snow and
winds." 
</P>
<P>
But this area is also stunningly beautiful, and Father Martin Gusinde
has 
compared the Yamana, a sister tribe, to 'fidgety birds of passage who
were 
happy and inwardly calm only when they were on the move'). In two recent
works, 
Bruce Chatwin ("The Songlines") and Mario Vargas Llosa ("El Hablador"
("The 
Speaker") ) convincingly draw the reader into the soul-life, the
Earth-bound 
myths and legends of the Australian Bushmen and the Peruvian
Machiguengas, 
respectively. Raspail is far less successful in a parallel attempt with
the 
Alacalufs, and the fault is not in Jeremy Leggatt's translation, which
is 
excellent. 
</P>
<P>
Despite that limitation, Raspail's story, inscribed in the dialogue of
cultures 
so characteristic of our age, is a fine version in historical fiction of
a true 
story loud with ethical reverberations. As First-World nations, we are 
collectively responsible for the fate of colonized and subjugated
peoples in 
the Third World, but we have hardly begun to address those
responsibilities.

As a curly-headed child star, she was grand marshal of the 1939 parade
50 years 
ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back
to be 
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m.
(to be 
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a
select 
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard
Nixon and 
Earl Warren.

FICTION IN BRIEF: ROCK ME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This novel's hip style, smooth tone and sensual spirit distinctively
recall the 
music of Steely Dan, a resemblance which turns out to be more than
accidental, 
for Marcelle Clements lives with Donald Fagen, Steely Dan's lead singer
and 
composer. Clements, a journalist, wrote "Rock Me" in part to evoke the
lives of 
the musicians she first met at New York City's High School of Music and
Art and 
then toured with in a yearlong stint as one of Fagen's backup singers.
On this 
level, "Rock Me" is absorbing and believable. Casey and Michael,
Clements' 
protagonists, are accurate portrayals of 1960s rockers grappling with
the late 
1980s. Up on shrinks, down on drugs (after years of riding high) and
longing 
for friendship though often sidetracked by lust, they speak in a
delightfully 
spacey dialect from somewhere in between the San Fernando Valley and the
New 
School for Social Research: "It's just been a horrible grind for so
long," 
Casey tells Michael, "that now I have this, like, unbelievable negative
tropism 
about all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes Clements' language, with no evidence of satire, strays from
the 
eccentric to the insipid. "You really have a great tan," Casey tells
Michael. 
"I hope so," he responds. "Because that's all I have." Clements' point
of view 
is also stylistically problematic, changing from first to third person
for no 
apparent reason. A final problem is Clements' attempt to study a love
triangle. 
Casey, the burnt-out lead singer in a highly successful band, leaves New
York 
City to recuperate in Hawaii. There, she meets Michael, her former lover
and 
band partner, and his girlfriend Leslie. Sensing the desire between
Casey and 
Michael, Leslie, hardly monogamous herself, sanctions an affair between
the 
two. Casey and Michael eventually make love, but rather than confronting
her 
feelings toward Michael, Casey abruptly returns to New York, riddled
with guilt 
over her "dirty deed." 
</P>
<P>
Clements' portrait of Casey, nevertheless, is an intimate and credible
sketch 
of a neurotic artist. Casey returns to New York confused, but creatively 
reinvigorated, concluding that she can only realize her fantasies in her
music: 
"The best affair is the affair you don't have . . . except in your
songs."

MEMORIES OF A CHINESE-AMERICAN BOYHOOD; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHINAMAN PACIFIC &amp; FRISCO R.R. CO. BY FRANK CHIN (COFFEE HOUSE
PRESS: 
$9.95; 184 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Douglas Sun, Sun, a Chinese-American graduate student at the
University of 
Chicago, is seeking a publisher for his first novel. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I think of some friends of mine from the old neighborhood (all of
whom had 
the proper ethnic credentials, let me assure you), one thing I remember
is our 
wariness of what we called "I Have a Problem" literature. By that, we
meant 
literature of ethnic experience at its most tiresome: brooding,
Angst-ridden 
story-polemics, crammed to the gills with resentment and righteous
anger, about 
existential misery in the Land of the Round-Eye; literature that seemed
to 
assume that any bit of drivel was worth your attention just as long as
it had a 
chip on its shoulder. It's a species related to what Calvin Trillin
called the 
"kvetch novel" -- any novel in which you want to say to the main
character, 
"Oh, just pull up your socks" -- only more irritating. But it's also an
easy 
trap for anyone who writes from an ethnocentric point of view to fall
into. It 
is, therefore, to Frank Chin's credit that his collection of short
stories, 
"The Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." by and large avoids this
trap even 
as it dances on the edge of the pit. 
</P>
<P>
There are eight stories in this volume, most of them autobiographical in
tone. 
Almost all have as their essential subject the alienation of
Chinese-America 
from the America of white skin and Wonder Bread. The first two,
"Railroad 
Standard Time" and "The Eat and Run Midnight People," read like
meandering 
stream-of-consciousness memoirs and are self-indulgent enough to make
them the 
weakest of the bunch. The final story, "The Sons of Chan," clothes
itself in 
shreds of fiction with some interesting Freudian overtones, but it is
otherwise 
a tiring screed on growing up with the stereotypes in Charlie Chan
movies as 
your only reflection in popular culture. Chin's rhetoric is often sharp
and 
funny, but he also rides the high horse of racial bitterness for more
than it's 
worth. 
</P>
<P>
It's the other five stories that distinguish "The Chinaman Pacific &amp;
Frisco 
R.R. Co." In them, Chin displays two considerable writerly virtues. One
is a 
wicked sense of humor that runs a provocative gamut from jangled whimsy
to 
scathing satire. His subject matter is weighty enough so that an amusing 
conceit or figuration often balances out the mood. This is particularly
true of 
"A Chinese Lady Dies," in which the narrator's problematic (and
disturbingly 
Oedipal) relationship with his mother evokes such tension that the story
would 
self-immolate without the whimsical dream passages in which he imagines
himself 
as an Old-Western hero called E. Chino. His wit feels more like a dagger
than a 
feather, but is no less amusing for it. And for good measure, Chin tacks
on an 
afterword that reads suspiciously like a freewheeling satire on Maxine
Hong 
Kingston's "The Woman Warrior." 
</P>
<P>
 His other primary virtue is his considerable skill as a storyteller. He
has a 
genuine gift for bringing characters and their predicaments alive. One
sees 
this most vividly in "The Only Real Day," which focuses on the struggle
of an 
aged immigrant to keep American culture at bay and preserve his identity
as a 
Chinese. Chin has a definite point to make in this story about the
corrosion of 
Chinese values and identity in a mostly white world, but the message is 
filtered so thoroughly through the plot and well-drawn characters that
it has 
no didactic harshness. It is, above all, a poignant and entrancing piece
of 
fiction. "Yes, Young Daddy," which depicts the protagonist's
relationship with 
a female cousin who is grappling with adolescence, is also worth noting
for its 
skillful portraiture. 
</P>
<P>
Chin's prose style tends toward a looseness vaguely reminiscent of
William S. 
Burroughs. It's lively stuff but also slow going at times, what with the 
missing antecedents, plastic sentence structure and all. He also enjoys
playing 
fast and loose with temporal shifts in his stories, with the result that 
memory, present experience, anticipation and pure fantasy often overlap.
It's 
an absorbingly dense reflection of the way in which past, present and
future 
come to bear upon each other in the mind, but everything melds so
seamlessly 
that the reader may have some trouble keeping things sorted. 
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Chin does a good job of avoiding the hazards that could
have 
swallowed up these stories. Although alienation is the great theme of 
post-World War II American literature and our age is distinguished by
its 
voices from outside the mainstream, just because a work is about racial 
alienation doesn't automatically make it worth reading. The problem with 
ethnocentric literature is that its force is so centripetal. It tends to
reach 
inward, instead of outward toward the universal significance that, as
Northrop 
Frye said, marks literature in its highest form. Fiction need not reach
that 
level to be worth our while, but it should at least show a human
dimension that 
will move us and provoke us, as mere formalized pique cannot.
Fortunately, "The 
Chinaman Pacific &amp; Frisco R.R. Co." achieves such transcendance
often 
enough to make it worthwhile fiction.

The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory,
commencing 
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture
spoof, 
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast. 
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar
winner, 
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part
of the 
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is
an 
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in
this 
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top
stunt 
women. 
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday
at 8 
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in
which 
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit
from 
staging a terrible play. 
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred 
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing
with a 
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in
the 
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32
from 
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's
brother 
and singing partner Richard. 
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a
Wonderful 
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a
sweet-and-sour 
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde
of 
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures. 
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is
a 
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007
(Timothy 
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights").
This 
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an 
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's
head 
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film
maker 
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny 
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of
Information 
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his
cherished 
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern 
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats,
the 
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever
they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars
Ricky 
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption
in a 
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star. 
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on
Saturday at 10 
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer
who, 
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek)
all the 
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed
film 
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and
youth, 
California-style. 
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie
updating 
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman
(Stephanie 
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue
McClanahan, Tony 
Randall and Edward Woodward star. 
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.)
is one 
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making
of a 
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to
make a 
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and
reality 
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin. 
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.)
plays 
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic
splices 
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of
goofy 
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits,
boobs and 
cads. 
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic
Scarface 
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to
Miami's 
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle,
it 
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title
role as a 
doomed drug kingpin.

PICTURING MANZANAR; 
</P>
<P>
MANZANAR BY JOHN ARMOUR AND PETER WRIGHT PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANSEL ADAMS,
COMMENTARY 
BY JOHN HERSEY (TIMES BOOKS: $27.50; 167 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Kishiyama , Kishiyama, a Calendar assistant editor, was born in
the 
Heart Mountain, Wyo., relocation camp. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey
and 
photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is "Manzanar" and
the 
unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II,
the 
combination would seem to be explosive -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Eloquent and moving, Hersey's 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy
came 
into being: "The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for
the sweet 
land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on
false 
evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly
inalienable 
rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who
were 
not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country
had long 
denied people of their race the right to naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
Equally moving are Adams' photographs, originally taken to document life
in 
Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern
Sierra 
before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000 
Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hersey's contribution occupies only the first 66 pages.
Worse, 
Adams' pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures
he 
donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs
are 
reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at
your 
corner photo shop. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting Hersey and Adams' words and pictures tell the story,
the 
book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of 
Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate
three 
different approaches: outrage in Hersey's "A Mistake of Terrifically
Horrible 
Proportions," irony in Adams' "Born Free and Equal" and the bland in
Armour and 
Wright's "A Portrait of Manzanar." 
</P>
<P>
Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the 
President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the
horrifying 
mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not
the 
lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping
away at 
this stone wall the book's authors and publisher have to be
congratulated. 
</P>
<P>
But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention
that 
Ansel Adams' Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were 
criticized by some Japanese-Americans as "prettifying" the harsh camp 
experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden
pyschological scars 
from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long
since 
died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the
thought 
that they were "guilty" as never charged.

the story of seven children left to cope for themselves after their
parents 
die. Their father, The Rev. William Lord, expires at the breakfast table
one 
morning. After the family leaves for a ramshackle house owned by a
wealthy 
cousin, the mother loses her mind and then her life in an accident. 
</P>
<P>
The eldest daughter, Lily, takes charge of the entire household, as Jess 
becomes a favorite of her rich cousin Jackie and watches her rival for
Jackie's 
affections fall fatally from a mountaintop. 
</P>
<P>
These characters, "all talented, all deeply human, (are) all so
beautifully 
realized that by the end of the novel we identify with them to the point
of 
heartbreak," Carolyn See wrote in these pages. " 'Waiting for Childhood' 
manages to be at once terribly melancholy and extraordinarily
exhilarating."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: LEAVING HOME BY GARRISON KEILLOR (PENGUIN BOOKS:

Penguin Books has here collected 36 of the host of "A Prairie Home
Companion's" 
radio monologues, each beginning with the words "it has been a quiet
week in 
Lake Wobegon" -- a town "where all the women are strong, the men are 
good-looking, and all the children are above average." 
</P>
<P>
Those who have been charmed by Keillor's wistful American pastoral will
be 
pleased to learn, as Dan Sullivan put it in his review, that "Keillor
doesn't 
ramble as much in type as he did on the air. Something else does come
across 
better on the page: the realization that Lake Wobegon does not exist. .
. . 
Every now and then, the whole town starts to waver, like a mirage, and
you see 
Keillor . . . wondering whether to send a character into her house to
discover 
the mess that her kids have made, or to let her take a walk around the
block 
first."

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE RACE TO FASHODA EUROPEAN COLONIALISM AND AFRICAN

On May 10, 1896, acting on a report by French engineer Victor Prompt
that the 
headwaters of the Nile could be dammed up, "turning the great waterway
on and 
off like a bathtub spigot," Capt. Jean-Baptiste Marchand sails from
Marseilles 
to the French Congo and begins his trek across Africa to the Nile with
150-odd 
Senegalese soldiers. They arrive in Fashoda in July, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the British launch an Anglo-Egyptian army of 30,000 men
under 
the leadership of Herbert Kitchener. These men build a railroad across
the 
desert, meet up with another 60,000-man army and arrive in Fashoda in 
September, 1898. 
</P>
<P>
"On September 19, Marchand and Kitchener exchanged champagne toasts
aboard a 
British gunboat anchored off Fashoda before politely threatening to
destroy 
each other," David Levering Lewis writes in this absorbing history. "On 
November 4, Paris ordered recently promoted Major Marchand to abandon
his 
fortress." 
</P>
<P>
Drawing from the archives of African states, from newly translated
political 
correspondence as well as memoirs, Lewis exposes the sometimes absurd
imperial 
energies of European states and the emerging role of African nations.

Negotiations are under way for Dustin Hoffman to play the title role in 
Warners' on-again, off-again "Phantom" -- the opera story updated to 
Nazi-occupied Germany. Originally at Lorimar, the script's recently been 
revamped by James Dearden ("Fatal Attraction"), with filming to begin in
April. 
Wolfgang Petersen directs and co-produces with C.O. Erickson. . . .
Family 
ties: Actor-producer James Keach makes his directorial debut with "The 
Forgotten," the story of Vietnam MIAs released after 17 years'
imprisonment. 
But a sinister plot develops when the soldiers are debriefed in Berlin.
It 
stars Keith Carradine, Stacy Keach and Steve Railsback, who 
co-wrote/co-produces with Keach, James. Mimi Maynard and Sandra Will, 
respectively the wives of James Keach and Carradine, also have roles. 
Production starts late January for Paramount. . . . 
</P>

Emily Lloyd will star in "Letters for Iris," the story of a young woman
who 
becomes a nanny as a means to avenge a terrible wrong. Israel Horvitz
wrote the 
yarn, which films late spring in Boston, for producer Robert Lawrence.
Burt 
Young joins Joseph Mantegna and Faye Dunaway in Zoetrope's "Wait Until
Spring, 
Bandini," filming in Utah next February. Fred Roos, Erwin Provoost and

Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was
dismaying. 
Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by
client 
or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel
just as 
tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract
with 
another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is
unfortunate 
that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even
if it is 
only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.

Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating 
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young
is 
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the
article 
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching
them 
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach)
boasts 
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the 
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black,
regularly 
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting,
part-time 
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive
from 
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam
(as just 
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science 
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site
where 
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes
and 
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.

ART NEWS: AN EXHIBIT WHOSE TIME HAS COME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any
exhibit. 
Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing
a show 
of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was "relegated
to the 
dust bins." Today, as "Abstract Options" is about to open, that is all
changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since
the 
mid-'80s," said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the
32-painting 
exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at
UCSB to 
teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. "Neo Expressionism was
so 
rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art
in 
artists' studios." 
</P>
<P>
Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented
in the 
show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of
surface 
and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness. 
</P>
<P>
"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting,"
Plous said. 
"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don't like
the 
word pretty very much, but I think it's going to be a beautiful show." 
</P>
<P>
Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi
Gluck, 
Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M.
Miller, 
Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa
Barbara 
through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles'
most 
active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate
on his 
own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa
Monica 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to have more studio time," Westmoreland said, now making
mostly 
mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra
Mendelson 
Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of
the 
high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland's exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated
works 
for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland's
efforts that 
he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for
local 
emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high
school's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal was La Monte's doing," said Alexander, one of this
city's 
best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High
School. "His 
enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed 
Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, "Paintings and Sculptures," Jan. 5
through 
Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.) 
</P>
<P>
LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may
apply for 
grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the
fourth year 
of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200
are 
available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively.
For 
information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott
heads 
up the program. 
</P>
<P>
IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern 
nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. "Going Public: A Field
Guide to 
Developments in Art in Public Places" was produced with the input of 30 
nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design
professionals 
and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to
examine 
public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service
at the 
University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.

RESTAURANT NOTEBOOK: FLOCKING TOGETHER AND CHICKENING OUT

Chicken is chicken, right? Well, not always, it appears. A new catalogue
of 
chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier
of 
pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over
200 
variations on the theme. There's Hume Dingher's 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry
chicken, 
for instance ("Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts,
and 
vegetables into one chicken recipe"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast
Fillets 
("IT'S MICROWAVEABLE!"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets
("Here is 
a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those
Central 
and Southern European spices America loves best"). 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium)
Curried Brest 
(sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip'n Chik'n Nuggets,
Taste 
O'Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and
Whirlibirds 
(the latter, of course, being "Fully cooked, breaded chicken
breast-and-thigh 
meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons"). 
</P>
<P>
It's nice to know that somebody like Pierce is out there making the 
restaurateur's life easier, isn't it? 
</P>
<P>
READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle
be 
eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms, 
asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They'll be
sampling 
these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in
the 
nation's capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of
L.A.'s 
own Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy
Schmidt -- 
who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an
appropriate 
site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the
old 
presidential suite at Washington's Union Station, built for the use of
Teddy 
Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another
Rattlesnake 
Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort
of 
name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club
is a 
great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to serve wild hors d'oeuvres," says Schmidt. "You know
those 
politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of
hands. 
They'll probably be so busy talking that they'll only take little bites
of 
things -- so I've got to get my licks in quick." 
</P>
<P>
Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya
(hearts-of-palm 
blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and
green 
olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of
Chinese-style plum 
sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis
for 
talking about Belgian endive? 
</P>
<P>
SALT AND PEPPER: Cafe Prego is new on La Cienega, on the site of the
former 
L'Angolo (among other restaurants). . . . Marc Ehrler, former chef for
the 
French ambassador in Washington, is the new executive chef at the San
Ysidro 
Ranch in Montecito. Ehrler replaces Bryan Carr, who has moved to the El
Encanto 
Hotel in Santa Barbara. . . .

I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as 
close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste
Makers, 
Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels
that 
theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very
far. I'm 
sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste. 
</P>
<P>
If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or
artistic 
desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea
there, or 
would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!

PASTIMES: AROUND HOME;

<P>
STENCILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now 
decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and
floors. 
Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries,
when it 
was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled
designs were 
used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings. 
</P>
<P>
The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various
shapes in 
a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a
surface 
through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of
repetition: 
Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a
fraction of 
the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to
paint them 
by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end
result, 
when done well, looks professionally neat and precise. 
</P>
<P>
Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just
some 
paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before 
launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing
to 
master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the
stencil 
brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be
wielded with 
an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be
stenciled 
determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on
the 
brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard
deck 
enamel will resist all paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has
issued a 
series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting. 
Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy's Carousel Crafts
and 
Rainbow Craft, both in Burbank, and at Craf-T-Mac's in La Habra.
Supplies are 
available at Aaron Bros. stores, Kit Kraft in Studio City, Stat's in
Pasadena, 
and Michael's in Torrance. UCLA Extension plans to offer a stenciling
class in 
the spring quarter.

DAT AND LUDDITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding John C. Dvorak's Dec. 11 Viewpoints column, "Why DAT Isn't 
Un-American": 
</P>
<P>
I must agree with Dvorak. It is not digital audio tape that is
un-American, but 
rather the Recording Industry Assn. of America itself. 
</P>
<P>
The attitudes and actions of the RIAA very closely parallel those of the 
Luddites, the early 19th-Century English workmen who destroyed
labor-saving 
machinery to "protect" the economy. The Luddites could not see that if
textiles 
could be more easily manufactured and sold for less, more people could
afford 
more of them. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, the RIAA was wrong about standard audio cassettes,
wrong about 
videocassette recorders and now also wrong about DAT. Audio cassettes
boosted 
sales of long-playing records, and VCRs boosted motion picture revenues.
The 
RIAA would like to punish the entire country for the supposed wrongs of
the 
proverbial bootlegging pirates. This is not only unfair but ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
The RIAA's special-interest politicking may have hurt the introduction
of DAT, 
but it won't be able to stop read/write compact discs. Everything seems
to be 
going digital. It's just a matter of time.

'89 WISH LIST: PROTECTION, TAXES AND PEACE; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIAL BENEFITS, DEFICIT REDUCTION ARE TOP PRIORITIES FOR THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What changes would you like to see in business practices and the
workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the
economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by
people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage
in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that
the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The
LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the
extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be
allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the
leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to
our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country
because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that
if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to
this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on
the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget
deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the
next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There
should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real
problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind
of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do
likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to
offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps
through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County
Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President
relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing
efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs
because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers
are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to
correct 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible"
investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing.
People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment
in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very
easy to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way
their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of
women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a
number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut
and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax.
This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman
of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after
advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It
would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the
value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One
of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and
author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of
former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was
nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of
Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for
business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old,
since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis
officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see
democracy 
subverted if current trends persist. 
</P>
<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people,
and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and
unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern
Methodist 
University: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the
economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government,
both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . .
and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds
of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in
the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that
would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the
dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor
polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some
kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I
think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The
kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)?
How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different
groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well
resolved. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political
threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I
would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better
develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to
reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual
economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we
have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people.
. . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and
water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects
all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop
killing 
dolphins."

MEDIAN HOME PRICES, SALES UP IN NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Median prices and sales of resale detached houses and condominiums rose
in 
November, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
November sales of detached houses in California rose 4.9% over October,
thanks 
to a brief dip in interest rates and strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
Detached houses sold at an annual rate of 597,000 in November compared
to 
569,330 in October. The November figure was 17% higher than last
November 
making it the highest in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
The state's median sales price for resale houses rose 1.2% in November
to 
$177,485. This was a 23.6% jump from November, 1987, when the median was 
$143,554. Joel Singer, chief economist of the realtors' group, said lack
of 
inventory helped to cause the price rise. 
</P>
<P>
Condominium resales rose 0.2% over October but 48.4% over November,
1987. The 
median condominium price fell 2.7%, to $126,328 in November from
$129,869 in 
October. Even so, November's median price was 10.4% higher than a year
ago, 
when it was $114,457.

INTERIOR DESIGN IMPORTANT TO VISUALLY IMPAIRED PERSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Interior design can have more impact on the visually impaired than on
those who 
see normally, according Jean Bast of the San Diego chapter of the
American 
Society of Interior Designers. 
</P>
<P>
Chapter members have been volunteering their services to redesigning and 
renovating the San Diego Service Center for the Blind, using techniques
and 
design applications that will transform it into an integrated
"way-finding" 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
Most furnishings are also being donated to the $500,000 renovation of
the 
8,000-square-foot center. Design applications will include the use of
brightly 
colored accents on walls and floors, improved overhead lighting to
reduce 
glare, lighting in handrails and heavily textured walls, said Jan Bast,
the 
chairman of the ASID design team. 
</P>
<P>
"To call this a center for the blind is somewhat a misnomer, since most
of the 
people utilizing the center are partially sighted," Bast added. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 80% of the 2,200 people using the San Diego facility are elderly,
and 
design efforts have also gone into special furnishings for that group.
For the 
totally blind, different, heavily textured wall coverings and varying
floor 
surfaces will enhance their ability to find their way.

Two predictions for 1989: There isn't going to be a Bush Revolution. But
George 
Bush will have to pay the price for the Reagan Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
We know there won't be a Bush Revolution because, with one exception,
none of 
the people Bush has appointed to policy-making positions is a
revolutionary. 
They are in the mold of Secretary of State-designate James A. Baker III,
who 
was reviled by conservatives when he was Ronald Reagan's chief of staff;
Atty. 
Gen. Richard Thornburgh, who has served in the Nixon, Ford and Reagan 
administrations; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who is closer to
Wall 
Street than to the supply-siders on the Republican right, and Brent
Scowcroft, 
Bush's national security adviser, who is known to harbor serious doubts
about 
Reagan's "Star Wars" program. In other words, Bush has assembled a team
of 
cautious, moderate, pragmatic, Establishment Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
The one exception is Jack Kemp, Bush's proposed secretary of housing and
urban 
development. Kemp has never held an executive position before, and he is 
brimming over with radical new ideas. Kemp's is regarded as a token
appointment 
to a secondary Cabinet position, however, made to mollify the GOP's
right wing. 
(Quiz: Who is Reagan's secretary of housing and urban development? Hint:
He is 
the only Cabinet member who served for Reagan's entire two terms. Give
up? 
Here's another hint: He is the only black in Reagan's Cabinet. Still
stumped? 
The answer is Samuel R. Pierce Jr. If you didn't know, don't worry.
Reagan 
himself didn't recognize Pierce at a White House reception several years
ago.) 
</P>
<P>
Actually, radical new ideas are what is needed for dealing with the
major 
problem under Kemp's purview, namely, the national scandal of
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
Other than Kemp, the only controversial appointments Bush has made were
to 
political rather than policy-making positions -- John H. Sununu as White
House 
chief of staff, Lee Atwater as Republican Party chairman and Dan Quayle
as vice 
president. None has to be confirmed by the Senate. And the Bush people
are 
still trying to figure out something for Quayle to do. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, when it comes to policy positions, there are no James P.
Watts, no 
William J. Caseys, no Edwin Meese IIIs, no William J. Bennetts. The
Reagan 
Administration gave us bold new ideas. The Bush Administration will give
us 
something we rarely got from Reagan -- professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
Congress seems impressed by Bush's professionalism. Even Democrats
express 
admiration for the professionalism of his presidential campaign. "It was
a 
nasty campaign," said House Majority Whip Tony Coelho (D-Merced), "but 
basically it was a professional campaign. They knew what had to be done
and 
they did it." 
</P>
<P>
Right now, we are in one of the rare periods of make-nice in Washington.
Bush's 
efforts to bind up the wounds of the campaign are paying off. He has
bought 
himself a honeymoon. Conservatives are holding their fire; they don't
want to 
be seen as abandoning the new President before he even takes office. The
press 
is happy because the President-elect has held more press conferences
this year 
than the President. 
</P>
<P>
Congress and Bush are engaged in an elaborate Alphonse-and-Gaston
routine. Each 
side expresses great admiration for the other. One says, "Oh please, you
be the 
first to reveal your budget plans." "Oh no, I couldn't possibly," says
the 
other. "Please, you go first." As in the court of the Sun King at
Versailles, 
the ritual courtesy masks a deadly clash of ambitions. Each side wants
to seize 
the dagger and drive it into the other's heart. 
</P>
<P>
Taxes are the dagger. He who proposes new taxes gets it in the neck. As
Sen. 
John Breaux (D-La.), the new chairman of the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign 
Committee, put it, "Bush is the one who laid down the gauntlet -- read
my lips, 
no new taxes. If we go out and break his promise for him, we get the
blame for 
it and he gets the credit. No one wants to fall into that trap." 
</P>
<P>
In other words, as soon as the deficit comes up, the honeymoon ends. It
will be 
hard for Bush to do what Reagan has done for the last eight years,
namely, 
pretend the deficit is not his problem. 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's foreign policy. In this case,
a break 
with the Republican right is inevitable. The right always resented the
fact 
that Reagan abandoned his "evil empire" agenda in order to pursue arms
control 
and detente. They dared not protest, however. "Reagan could always go
over our 
heads to our own people at the grass roots," said conservative activist
Paul 
Weyrich. "Bush won't be able to do that. He needs us." Bush and
Scowcroft do 
not show much enthusiasm for "Star Wars." Bush and Baker have decided to 
postpone asking Congress for new military aid to the Contras. The Reagan 
Administration, with Bush's full support, has begun talking to the
Palestine 
Liberation Organization. Some time this year, conservatives are going to
say, 
"Enough!" 
</P>
<P>
Bush will also pay the price for Reagan's social agenda. Here the break
will be 
not with Congress or the GOP right, but with the American public. It
will 
happen as soon as the Supreme Court reverses its historic 1973 Roe vs.
Wade 
decision that defined abortion as a constitutionally protected human
right. 
Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who wrote Roe vs. Wade, has warned that
abortion 
rights may soon "go down the drain." Four of the nine current Supreme
Court 
justices want to overturn the Roe decision, and three of Roe's
supporters are 
in their 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Roe will go. And when that happens, all hell will break loose. "Taking
away 
rights that have already been given is a hard thing to pull off," said
Kate 
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League. 
Millions of American women have had abortions. Despite increased
restrictions, 
the abortion rate has remained steady at 1.5 million a year during the
Reagan 
years. A decision recriminalizing abortion will be as divisive for
Republicans 
as the 1954 school desegregation decision was for Democrats. Reagan was
lucky. 
He demanded an end to abortions but it didn't happen on his watch. Bush
won't 
be so lucky.

Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year's
resolutions to 
propose: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Balance Proposition 103's attack on soaring insurance premiums with
curbs 
on claim costs and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit 
current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the 
Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and
not 
merely cosmetic tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in
California 
should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues
like 
health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls
and 
regional government. 
</P>
<P>
How realistic are these resolutions? That's not easy to predict. Because
what 
happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George
Deukmejian, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence
policy 
direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the
best 
chance to keep the governor's chair Republican and thus prevent a
Democratic 
gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn
naysaying 
and attempt to build a legacy? 
</P>
<P>
Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he's
again 
mulling wholesale budget chopping. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking
and 
concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for
state 
government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping
at 
Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer by Brown's lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's definition of "doing policy" is crucial. Policy-making is
not 
selectively taking over legislators' bills and ramming them through the 
Assembly. A "boutique" approach to problem-solving is not leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then
protects 
their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor's office,
too. He 
stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then
stymie 
legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the 
state's trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of
comprehensive 
insurance reform.) 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy,
legislators 
have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their
own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross
Johnson of 
La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games
designed to 
wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a
"kinder, 
gentler" redistricting? 
</P>
<P>
Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and
not risk 
any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their
continued 
political survival? 
</P>
<P>
Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento's political 
gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate
until 
reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of
Sepulveda 
speculated, "If more solutions don't start coming out of this place,
then no 
one will be around for reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
If this prediction doesn't stir some resolve in Sacramento, nothing
will.

ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Armstrong, George Armstrong is the Rome correspondent for
Britain's 
Guardian newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
ROME 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last
century, 
a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one
of the 
luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been
held by 
millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian
capital in 
1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal
City 
seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer.
For 
them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when 
everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in
from 
the hills to join the Roman circus. 
</P>
<P>
Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of
Rome 
is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and
the city 
"does not deserve to be the capital." For him, Rome is "the only
Levantine city 
without a European quarter." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in 
interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was
speaking for 
them, and then angry words from the city's political bosses. Some of
their 
responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the
natural 
capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World. 
</P>
<P>
This, Firpo said, was "imperial rhetoric." Harking back to the empire
was also 
one of Benito Mussolini's gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing
from 
his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as
being the 
city's third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome
of the 
Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the
Italy of 
his time as being "more a geographical expression than a country." A
little 
later, Firpo's native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that
borders 
Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that
Italy 
should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the
Roman 
Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome
would be 
the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign 
domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification
supporter, 
the Marquis Massimo D'Azeglio, said, "We've created an Italy -- now we
must 
create the Italians." A strong argument could be made that his second
goal is 
still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome
on 
Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been
the 
Pope's residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer
than 
200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian
peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Today Rome's official population is 3 million, but each day it continues
to 
attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the
bright 
lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the
outskirts, 
without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts,
built 
2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero's baths, are now bricked up by 
migrants and serve as dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was
titled, 
"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected." That was, and
probably 
is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in
northern 
Italy toward the nation's capital. Each year the northern regions see
their tax 
payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an
area 
just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome 
native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks,
reminding him 
that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid
buildings 
and private gardens to make Rome "more modern." A few days later,
Moravia 
recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and
offered 
proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia had said: "Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European
capital, 
like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a
sterile 
bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though
the 
center of the church, it is the world's least spiritual city. Religion
is 
present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There
is no 
circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of 
either." 
</P>
<P>
When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital,
he 
said, "Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country." Both he and Moravia
agree 
that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence --
is only 
their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra,
Brasilia 
or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy's central government
and the 
entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both
ancient and 
modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila
the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his
temporal 
control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the
nation's 
capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major
cultural 
influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again
accept 
Naples as a sovereign seat. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for
centuries. They 
are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other
peoples' hats. 
They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering
volcano 
need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers,
writers, 
architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one. 
</P>
<P>
Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have
tilted the 
scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean
country, not 
what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Luigi Firpo's rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for 
millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and,
incidentally, 
probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy
and who 
find themselves beating their heads against the city's bureaucratic
rubber 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from
the 
union. Both sides would be winners.

NICARAGUA STRUGGLES TO AID ITS CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Nelson, Harry Nelson, a former health and medical writer for
The 
Times, specializes in Third World health issues. 
</P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
MANAGUA, NICARAGUA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eight years of socially and economically devastating war with
U.S.-backed 
Contra forces -- topped off 10 weeks ago by the most destructive
hurricane in 
decades -- have sucked much of the substance but not the spirit from 
Nicaragua's 3.6 million people. 
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Nicaraguans talked enthusiastically of government
campaigns to 
reduce infant mortality, eradicate malaria, distribute land to the
landless and 
wipe out illiteracy. 
</P>
<P>
For a while great strides were made toward realizing those goals. But
today, 
for the first time since the revolution that overthrew dictator
Anastasio 
Somoza in 1979, children beg on the streets as government officials
reluctantly 
slash health programs that once drew international praise. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to help hundreds of thousands of Nicaraguan children who
have been 
displaced, wounded, orphaned or otherwise traumatized by the Contra war,
the 
U.S. Congress appropriated $17.7 million. Two days after President
Reagan 
signed the bill on Oct. 1, President Daniel Ortega said Nicaragua would
not 
accept the money. 
</P>
<P>
To Nicaraguans, refusing the aid was a symbol of dignity and national
pride. 
Tied to the legislation was a second bill that provided a similar amount
in 
non-lethal aid to the Contras, the very forces whose attacks on civilian 
outposts were -- and still are -- responsible for the misery of many
children. 
</P>
<P>
For Nicaragua to have accepted the aid, said Paul Oquist, an adviser to
Ortega, 
would be comparable to the United States having accepted a donation of
blood 
from Japan following the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to help children, lift the trade embargo and stop the
war," 
he said. "That would stop the production of orphans and allow more
(Nicaraguan) 
resources to deal with the problem ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Critics of the Sandinistas say the party's bungling management of the
economy 
is the real reason for its desperate straights. They accuse the
Sandinistas of 
torpedoing peace efforts with the Contras, suppressing the opposition
press, 
squelching political dissent and endlessly confounding friend and foe
alike 
with contradictory actions. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, representatives of U.S. and foreign relief agencies based
here 
and even mothers who have lost sons in the war say they supported
Ortega's 
action. 
</P>
<P>
A summary of the immense effects of the war on children appears in a 
little-publicized report prepared last summer by a team of American
health 
professionals sent to Nicaragua on behalf of the U.S. Agency for
International 
Development to assess children's needs. Among their findings, gleaned
from 
interviews with 40 humanitarian agencies working here and with the
Nicaraguan 
government: 
</P>
<P>
 -- About 500,000 of the nation's 1.8 million children under age 17 have
been 
directly affected through destruction or disruption of schools and other 
services, displacement from homes, death of parents, injuries and
psychological 
trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At least 455 children under 15 years have been killed and 691 are
missing 
through the end of 1987. Another 1,542 under 15 have been wounded, with
an 
additional 1,865 wounded among youngsters aged 15 through 20. About
1,200 have 
experienced serious physical handicaps such as amputations and 568
children 
have lost both parents, while 138 lost mothers and 9,371 lost fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- As many as 50,000 children have suffered psychological trauma after
seeing 
their villages shot up, parents or neighbors killed and having been
forced to 
resettle in strange areas. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cease-fire treaty of last spring, attacks on farm
cooperatives and 
killing and wounding of children continue. In October, in the province
of 
Jinotega, a well-marked Red Cross ambulance was shot up by Contras and
one 
passenger was wounded. The Contras also attacked a civilian truck,
killing nine 
civilians, three of them women. Two children injured in the attack later
died. 
Four civilians were killed in an attack in another province that
occurred only 
hours before Hurricane Joan struck on Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Two American physicians, Tim Takaro and Susan Cookson, who have worked
for two 
years in the Jinotega war zone, said $300,000 of the U.S. aid had been
slated 
for treating intestinal parasites in 30,000 children in their region.
But 
conditions imposed by the U.S. Agency for International Development,
which 
administers such aid funding, would have undermined the existing health
system 
in Nicaragua, they said. 
</P>
<P>
AID requires that any private agency receiving federal funds have no
connection 
with the Nicaraguan Health Ministry. Yet Takaro, Cookson and other U.S.
health 
workers here agree that all private agencies working in health cooperate
with 
the government system because that is the most efficient and economical
way to 
get services to the people. 
</P>
<P>
One of the Health Ministry's goals since the 1979 revolution has been to
expand 
health centers in rural areas. The policy saved many lives during the
Contra 
conflict. Last summer's report by the American team on the needs of
children 
noted with some surprise that the primary medical and social needs of
most 
war-injured and orphaned children had already been cared for within
government 
facilities. Most who required specialized care not available in
Nicaragua were 
sent to Eastern Bloc countries, it said. Several Health Ministry doctors
said 
there has been great difficulty arranging for specialized care in the
United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
The priority need now, the report said, is for continuing rehabilitation
within 
the children's own homes. 
</P>
<P>
All U.S. federal aid to Nicaragua was suspended in 1981. Some of the
slack has 
been taken up by U.S. allies, including Canada, Sweden, Holland, Italy,
France, 
Spain and other European countries who have contributed hundreds of
millions of 
dollars in medical supplies and assistance. Health Ministry officials
said the 
severe strains on the economy have forced them to charge for certain
health 
services that were previously free. 
</P>
<P>
Health workers have also been victims of Contra attacks. So far this
year, 
according to Takaro and Cookson, two volunteer Nicaraguan health workers 
(brigadistas) have been killed in Jinotega province alone, eight have
been 
kidnaped and three are missing. 
</P>
<P>
Because brigadistas live in communities where there is usually no doctor
or 
nurse, their services are highly valued. 
</P>
<P>
"They are hard to replace when killed because others become too
frightened to 
volunteer," Cookson said. "Eight health centers have been attacked by
Contras 
in Jinotega this year. Some were destroyed and the medicine supplies
were 
always destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Joan added to the general misery because of the destruction of
crops, 
homes, roads, bridges and service centers totaling $828 million,
according to 
the Social Welfare Ministry. Officials predict severe food shortages
beginning 
in the spring as a result of ruined bean and corn crops. The ministry
has 
called for $16.1 million in aid to clothe and feed for six months the
118,000 
children whose lives were disrupted by the hurricane.

ISRAELI COALITION AND ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For once, before offering such generous but the unasked for advice, put 
yourselves in Israel's place (editorial, "Israel: Starting Over," Dec.
21). The 
tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the
Jewish 
state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the
Copts, 
the Armenians, etc.) but also each other. 
</P>
<P>
Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a
country 
rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace
with 
Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously 
strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom
control the 
Palestine Liberation Organization? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and
terrorist 
organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And
what of 
"an international peace meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by
tanks 
and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the
Balts? 
The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently
witnessed to 
by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of
Pigs, 
the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece
will 
guarantee Israel's right to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity 
government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can 
guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such
generous 
advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its
destruction. 
We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the
historic 
Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a
slanted 
and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write
"Israeli-occupied 
West Bank," but never write "Soviet-occupied Estonia," or "provocative
Arab 
plans for the destruction of Israel."

Congratulations to Times staff writer Doug Smith and The Times for the 
heartwarming and inspirational story about Kenneth and Jolene Hodder,
newly 
commissioned Salvation Army officers (Metro, Dec. 24). 
</P>
<P>
How fortunate we are to be blessed with such unselfish and committed
young 
people in our efforts to cope with the myriad problems that beset our
society 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Faith in our way of life should be immensely strengthened in knowing

FIXING THE WRONG THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the two national political parties begin working together to make
things 
"better," better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and
Republicans 
formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate
away 
from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two
presidential 
campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real
debate 
but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session. 
</P>
<P>
Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do
something 
about the national political conventions. The commission has been
directed to 
propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more
appealing to 
Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings
that 
the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance
to 
carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring
Republican 
national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media
that the 
conventions "have become nothing more than staged activities in which
nominees 
give canned speeches." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs
fixing is 
the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces
winners 
long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have
control of 
the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of 
uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice
presidential 
running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of
any 
remaining tidbit of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and
start it 
someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to
have 
actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some
spontaneity and 
real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the
nomination. 
They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process,
and the 
convention problem will fix itself.

VERBAL VIRUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A brilliant hacker at Cornell University recently taught us how much
damage a 
computer virus can do to communications' nervous systems, but we had
long known 
that terminal disease has an electronic application. More troubling,
perhaps 
because more human, is a language virus, transmitted orally or on paper,
that 
spreads and replicates until meaning itself is destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The term sea-change, for example, surges through the media these days,
usually 
suggesting something mammoth -- as a sea-change in Soviet politics or a 
sea-change in Sean Penn's police relations. The original usage was 
Shakespeare's, and the bard was literally suggesting what the sea could
do to a 
human body. Only in 1988 did a tidal wave of sea-changes cover the land
as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably is, arguably, the latest fad in suggesting uncertainty. The
trouble is 
the way it appears everywhere and may confuse -- should be argued or may
be 
argued -- even as it hedges. 
</P>
<P>
A learned editor in this neighborhood has decided to forbid writers from
having 
anyone shoot himself or herself or themselves in the foot to describe 
inadvertent behavior. If all the recently shot feet stood end-to-end,
they 
would stretch the length of the John Muir Trail. 
</P>
<P>
Unique is a word that isn't. This virus has so infected the language
that 
particular or unusual or other simple, less assertive terms for rarity
have all 
but disappeared in favor of a one and only connotation -- usually false,
often 
in an advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
Cliches are the most common strain of language virus. Gobbledygook is
the 
mutation most often affecting bureaucrats and politicians who would
rather be 
obscure than be right. The National Council of Teachers of English
awarded 
Public Doublespeak citations for 1988 to the agricultural spokesperson
who 
called pigs and cows "grain-consuming animal units," and to the safety
expert 
who described an aircraft crash as "uncontrolled contact with the
ground." 
</P>
<P>
At this point in time, our lingering wheeze from Watergate days, there
is no 
vaccine for verbal virus. Susceptible word-consuming human units are
advised to 
avoid talk shows and look out for 30-second spots.

LITTLE CHOCOLATE DOUGHNUTS TELL THE TALE OF THE U.S. TRADE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEITH ROBINSON, Keith Robinson is a syndicated cartoonist in
Manhattan Beach 
whose book, Making It: a Survival Guide for Today, has just been
published by 
Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We hear a lot of talk that if the United States were allowed to compete
on an 
equal footing with foreign manufacturers, our product quality and
marketing 
skills would once again make us No. 1 in the world. Well, I offer for 
consideration the following true story (I've protected the names of the 
manufacturers involved, but any connoisseur of little chocolate
doughnuts will 
recognize their identities). 
</P>
<P>
Brand X is recognized as the Cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts --
light, 
fresh, with a chocolatey coating that is thick. Sweet. Oh-so-yummy. Most 
people's first choice. 
</P>
<P>
But we don't always have a choice. The micro-mini-market near me
(selling 
"booze 'n' munchies," according to its sign) carried only Brand Y --
heavy, dry 
little chocolate doughnuts with a dark, oil-slick coating that leaves
you 
looking as if you've just been fingerprinted. 
</P>
<P>
Still, when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate
doughnuts 
to get your day started, you take what you can get. 
</P>
<P>
(Anyone who asks why I don't just go to the supermarket once a week and
buy the 
ValuePak of Brand X little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading.
You've no 
understanding of the American consumer and will miss the point of the
story.) 
</P>
<P>
One morning, overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts, I
walked into 
the booze 'n' munchies store for a dose of Brand Y's LCDs. 
</P>
<P>
With a grimace, I bit into one. WHAM! Light, fresh! Oh-so-yummy! I
looked at 
the package: no "New and Improved!" No "Now with even MORE Chocolatey 
Goodness!" But yes -- they were good! Almost as good (dare I think it?)
as 
Brand X! 
</P>
<P>
I could purchase Brand Y little chocolate doughnuts proudly, no longer
afraid 
that others were looking upon me with scorn ("Mommy! He's buying Brand
Y!" 
"Don't point, Junior. Some people aren't as fortunate as we are. . .
."). It 
was a wonderful day! 
</P>
<P>
A month later the booze 'n' munchies store was sold. The new owner was
behind 
the counter one morning as I bought my pack of Brand Y little chocolate 
doughnuts. 
</P>
<P>
"Going to start getting Brand X," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Great, although these have gotten a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Well, now you'll have your choice." 
</P>
<P>
You'll have your choice! Boy, that's the American way. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, a few days later, there they were, side-by-side: Brand X
and Brand 
Y. What a great moment it was, being able to buy Brand X little
chocolate 
doughnuts, the BEST little chocolate doughnuts. Only. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Something strange hit me midway through my first pack of Brand X little 
chocolate doughnuts in months -- I missed Brand Y. Had I grown
accustomed to 
Brand Y's lower quality? Was Brand X too rich for my blood? 
</P>
<P>
The next day I held a taste test, alternating a little chocolate
doughnut from 
Brand X with one from Brand Y. After 12 little chocolate doughnuts, I
arrived 
at the startling conclusion: Brand Y had surpassed Brand X in chocolatey 
yumminess. I switched back to Brand Y. And I was happy. For about two
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
One morning I stumbled into the B 'n' M store for breakfast. No Brand Y
little 
chocolate doughnuts. They weren't just out -- the entire rack was gone.
Little 
chocolate doughnuts, cupcakes, wholesome snack pies -- everything. 
</P>
<P>
"The Brand Y people refused to be in the same store with Brand X,"
explained 
the owner. "Said if I kept selling Brand X, they'd pull out." 
</P>
<P>
"But I like their little chocolate doughnuts better than Brand X's," I 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
He shrugged. "Love to sell both, but Brand X has the better name." 
</P>
<P>
So I bought Brand X. Don't get me wrong -- they were good. But they
weren't 
Brand Y. 
</P>
<P>
Next morning, Brand X was sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"Distributor comes Thursdays," said the owner. This was Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
After a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend, I went into the store
Monday. 
There, where once the Brand Y rack had stood, was a rack of Brand Z
products -- 
cupcakes, wholesome snack pies and . . . little chocolate doughnuts. I
bought a 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
Eeyew! 
</P>
<P>
Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old Brand Y
little 
chocolate doughnuts were, but Brand Z little chocolate doughnuts, as I'm
sure 
you experts will agree, simply have no taste. They're only good for the 
desperate times when Brand X is sold out. 
</P>
<P>
Which is usually. The booze 'n' munchies store gets its shipment of
Brand X 
little chocolate doughnuts every Thursday. By Friday, they're sold out. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the guy every week to bring more," shrugs the owner. "Now, the
Brand Z 
guys, they always make sure we're stocked." 
</P>
<P>
Using the booze 'n' munchies store as our representative sample of the
American 
market, what have we learned? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand X, the brand with the best reputation, ignores feedback and
winds up 
selling a fraction what it could. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Y, the brand with the best product, refuses to compete in an
open 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brand Z, the worst of the three, is left to score the biggest sales. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as I sit here munching yet another Brand Z little chocolate
doughnut, I 
can't help but wonder. In the huge conglomerate headquarters of Brand
Z's 
parent company, just what language do you suppose they're speaking?

WHERE WAS U.S. IN NICARAGUA'S HOUR OF NEED?; 
</P>
<P>
DENIAL OF HUMANITARIAN AID CLASHES WITH OPEN HEARTS TOWARD ARMENIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICKEY LELAND, Rep. Mickey Leland (D-Tex.) is chairman of the House
Select 
Committee on Hunger. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sight of rescue teams from around the world ignoring politics and
rushing 
help to victims of the earthquake in Soviet Armenia has been one of the
bright 
spots of a holiday season dimmed by disaster. We in the United States
can take 
pride in our contribution. 
</P>
<P>
The instinctive response to the plight of the Armenians sent forth a
signal 
that the people of the world realize that we live in a global village.
Leaders 
of the Soviet Union abandoned their policy of secrecy and isolation
while 
long-time adversaries of the Soviet Union put aside past animosities. 
</P>
<P>
The lesson of Armenia is that politics is not an issue when human beings
have 
suffered terrible loss. A notable example came from an Israeli rescue
team, 
some of whom had emigrated from the Soviet Union with no thought of
returning. 
Although the two nations have not had diplomatic relations for more than
20 
years, this did not hinder the mission in Spitak and Leninakan. The team
stayed 
for more than two weeks, triumphing when a 15-year-old boy was pulled
alive 
from the debris eight days after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, there are children much closer to us geographically than
those 
in Armenia who are homeless and hungry and whose parents have lost their
lives 
or livelihoods in a natural disaster. These children and their families
have 
not received aid through the government of the United States. They are
the 
victims of Hurricane Joan in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
While the disaster in Armenia was of much greater dimension, Hurricane
Joan had 
a devastating effect on Nicaragua. It left 250,000 persons homeless.
Almost 3 
million people lost crops or otherwise suffered economic loss. Hospitals
and 
schools were damaged or destroyed. A team of United Nations economists
has 
estimated the loss at $840 million. 
</P>
<P>
Despite appeals from members of Congress and private groups such as
Oxfam and 
the American Friends Service Committee, the United States has refused 
assistance to Nicaragua. Jamaica and Costa Rica, hit by the same storm, 
received help from this country. There have been no explanations as to
why 
Nicaragua was counted out. Politics is the only apparent cause. 
</P>
<P>
Historically, U.S. policy has been to provide disaster relief as a
purely 
humanitarian gesture, independent of politics. This dates back to a
successful 
program led by Herbert Hoover to restore Europe after World War I and
has 
continued through the Marshall Plan until today. In 1988 such aid went
to 
victims of floods in Bangladesh and the Sudan, monsoons in India and
Nepal, 
Typhoon Ruby in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
These actions flow from the Foreign Assistance Act, which authorizes the 
President "to furnish assistance to any foreign country, international 
organization, or private voluntary organization, on such terms and
conditions 
as he may determine, for international disaster relief and
rehabilitation." The 
responsibility is clearly the President's. 
</P>
<P>
President Reagan, in a recent interview with David Brinkley, called
Nicaraguan 
President Daniel Ortega a "shameless dictator" who "doesn't stand in the
same 
box with (Soviet President Mikhail S.) Gorbachev." Has the politics of
aid 
reached the point of distinguishing between avowed communists when
giving or 
withholding humanitarian aid? Should we allow the behavior of the
Sandinistas 
to keep us from responding to people stricken by disaster? 
</P>
<P>
While we are not in open conflict with either the Soviet Union or
Nicaragua, 
the recent history of national enmity makes it imperative to maintain
the 
principle of nonpolitical humanitarian aid to innocent civilians. To
undermine 
this principle erodes the internationally accepted Geneva conventions
that have 
enabled the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and other agencies to bring
medicine 
and food to noncombatants in times of war. 
</P>
<P>
The only country in the world that could pose a serious, immediate
threat to 
the United States is the Soviet Union. Yet, we have responded generously
to 
innocent civilians in that country in their hour of need. Under
Anastasio 
Somoza, whose regime was more brutal and repressive, the United States
provided 
relief to Nicaraguan earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
Reporters have been told that the Nicaraguan government would not accept 
assistance if it were offered. The National Assembly did reject a
portion of 
the Contra aid package intended for all children who had been injured by
the 
civil strife. In mid-November Ortega clarified that the ban was limited
to the 
Contra package. Shortly thereafter, the Nicaraguan charge d'affaires in 
Washington said publicly that U. S. aid would be accepted through
international 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new openness of the Soviet government, as it welcomes outside help
and 
becomes more a part of the world community, is a sign to the incoming 
Administration to reverse a foreign policy that has too often put
ideology 
above basic human needs, above values that transcend government or
party. It is 
time to reaffirm the American tradition of generous response to need
simply 
because the need exists. 
</P>
<P>
Providing humanitarian aid promotes the national interests of the United 
States. We must recognize, however, that such aid makes its greatest 
contribution to our credibility and our reputation in the world when it
is 
delivered in a nonpolitical manner.

BY GOING FOR BROKE, U.S. FOULS FARM TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues
from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You don't need a Ph.D in economics to understand the European
Community's 
common agricultural policy. It sets artificially high farm prices that
create 
vast food surpluses. In November, for example, the world price for corn 
averaged $97 a metric ton. Meanwhile, the policy promised European
farmers a 
minimum price of $212, a 119% premium. Naturally, European farmers
produce as 
much as they can. Any surpluses are then dumped onto the world market
with huge 
subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
It's clear who's hurt. First come Europe's consumers and taxpayers.
Their food 
costs are too high, and 60% to 80% of the European Community's budget
goes to 
the policy. Next come more efficient farmers -- in the United States, 
Australia, Canada, Argentina and other nations -- who lose export sales
to the 
Europeans. Considering all these victims, there ought to be strong
pressure on 
the European Community to change the policy. Think again. An intense
U.S. 
campaign against the policy has had almost no success. 
</P>
<P>
It's a telling failure of economic diplomacy. Increasingly, the United
States 
can advance its economic interests abroad only with the help of other
nations. 
We're no longer so powerful that we can control the outcome of global 
negotiations. But we're clumsy at creating the international coalitions 
necessary to prevail. The farm negotiations (under the General Agreement
on 
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT) are a case in point. When the talks recently
broke 
down in Montreal, the Americans -- not the Europeans -- were mainly
blamed. 
</P>
<P>
Make no mistake: The talks are critical for U.S. agriculture. They may 
represent the best chance for America to cut its own costly farm
subsidies. 
American harvests are steadily rising; last summer's drought only
interrupted a 
long-term trend. Without expanding exports, U.S. farmers face rising
surpluses 
and falling prices. The pressures for continued subsidies would be
enormous. 
Other food exporters confront the same dilemma. Finally, greater
agricultural 
exports would help some developing countries escape the debt crisis. 
</P>
<P>
But somehow U.S. trade negotiators have turned a strong moral position
into 
political weakness. It's not that other food exporters like the
agricultural 
policy. They don't. Most of the European Community's minimum prices
(like that 
of corn) are set well above market levels. In November, the minimum
price for a 
metric ton of soybeans was $577, more than double the world price of
$267. 
Consumers pay these high prices. The Community maintains them by buying
any 
surpluses at the minimums. Cheaper imports are generally kept out with
variable 
levies that raise import prices slightly above the minimums. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that farmers elsewhere lose exports to Europe and must
compete 
with European food surpluses -- sold at subsidized prices -- in third 
countries. The policy's protection has kept high-cost farmers in
business. 
Efficient farmers are spurred to increase output by overusing
fertilizers and 
pesticides. Food production has soared. The European Community once
imported 
wheat; it became an exporter in the early 1970s. Since 1980, output of
oil 
seeds (such as soybeans) has more than quadrupled. 
</P>
<P>
By all logic, the Australians, Canadians and others ought to be loudly
echoing 
U.S. demands that the Europeans alter the policy. But the United States
has 
alienated its natural allies by insisting that all countries commit
themselves 
-- in advance of detailed negotiations -- to the eventual elimination of
most 
farm subsidies. For the Europeans, this would mean signing an immediate
death 
warrant for the policy. That's political suicide. It was this
humiliating 
demand that caused the breakdown at Montreal. Other governments regard
the U.S. 
position as wildly unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
It's also unnecessary. The issue is not (as the U.S. position implies)
all or 
nothing. Suppose the policy's excessive prices are cut 60% to 80% over a 
decade. That would be an immense achievement. But the talks are now
stalemated 
over a non-negotiable principle. The Europeans have scored a
public-relations 
coup and don't have to say how they'd change the policy to reduce its
adverse 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
The agricultural policy is not, of course, the only example of farm
folly. In 
addition to direct subsidies, the United States maintains import quotas
on 
sugar and dairy products. Japan and Korea restrict rice imports. Any
trade 
agreement would have to attack all these distortions. The political
obstacles 
are similar everywhere. Farmers have grown dependent on protection, and 
governments often depend on the votes of farmers. But opening up world 
agriculture is not a utopian dream. It has a big constituency -- food
exporters 
and, less obviously, taxpayers and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble is that the United States has yet to mobilize this
constituency. 
Any hard negotiation is full of drama and deadlocks. The GATT talks are 
scheduled to continue until 1990. They could yet succeed. But for that
to 
happen, the United States will have to pursue its goals more adeptly.
That's 
the real lesson here. Being right is not enough if, in the process,
everyone 
else is offended by American self-righteousness.

OUR FORCES ARE AT THE READY, BUT NOT FOR CUTBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By C. A. H. TROST, Adm. C.A.H. Trost is chief of naval operations.

<TEXT>
<P>
As concerns about the American economy grow, the debate over defense
spending 
continues at a feverish pace. An entire spectrum of ideas has been
placed 
before the public, with critics or "defense experts" having their own
agenda on 
how to cut defense in an effort to reduce the nation's budgetary
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
The discussions of cuts that indiscriminately have an impact on defense 
capabilities and current military readiness are both disconcerting and 
frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
The last eight years have seen some unmistakable gains in our military 
readiness and capability. U.S. naval forces (in fact, all U.S. military
forces) 
have never been stronger or more ready. America's position in the world
has 
also never been so strong. Our friends, who have never feared our
leadership 
and have only wanted to count on our strength, can do just that. And
potential 
adversaries now have to recalculate their ambitions because of our
strength. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we see a move by various people who seem hellbent on throwing
those 
gains away. 
</P>
<P>
Eight years ago, our political leaders -- with the support of the
American 
public -- committed themselves to an investment. The investment was a
large 
one, but was necessary to recover from the neglect of the 1970s when the 
military suffered from low states of readiness. Some ships couldn't sail 
because of material problems and personnel shortages; aircraft readiness
was 
low because of lack of spare parts and trained maintenance personnel;
morale 
problems abounded. 
</P>
<P>
This tremendous investment provided the nation with an extremely capable
fleet 
and a professional personnel force that has never been more dedicated,
spirited 
or well-trained. Simply stated, never has the Navy been more ready to
respond 
to a wide range of contingencies and threats. 
</P>
<P>
The question is, does the nation have the resolve to preserve its
investment or 
is it willing to return to the dark days of just a few years ago? To
allow the 
latter to happen and fail to protect the investment would be the biggest
case 
of fraud, waste and abuse this country has ever seen. History has
repeatedly 
shown us the consequences of complacency. 
</P>
<P>
The critics would like to make us believe that we can't afford a strong 
military. They argue that the defense buildup has caused the budget
deficit. 
Today, however, defense spending is less than 6% of our gross national
product. 
During the years of the so-called Reagan buildup, it was never more than
6.3% 
-- and it has declined steadily in the last four years. But 20 years
ago, that 
figure was 9% -- and we had a balanced federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
If one looks at a graph of defense and non-defense spending since 1969
(the 
last year of a balanced budget), we see that the curve for defense is 
relatively flat but that the curve for non-defense spending keeps
turning 
upward at an alarming rate. And the key point is that the curve almost
exactly 
matches the slope of our federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating for those in senior military positions -- those who
are 
directly responsible for providing for our nation's security and who had
to 
deal firsthand with our diminished capability in the last decade -- to
see the 
apparent complacency, the almost perverted idealism, the unscrupulous 
politicking and the inability to see reason and logic in the one element
of our 
great democracy in which the national interest should be above parochial 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
It is frustrating to deal with those who argue that because we have
built 
something that works, we can afford to neglect it for a while. It is 
frustrating to argue with those who can't stand success, who can't seem
to be 
comfortable with strength and who would apparently prefer being lovable
losers. 
</P>
<P>
Why are we turning our backs on defense? People listen to Soviet
President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, probably the greatest PR man in this century, and
they 
think, in the immortal words of Neville Chamberlain, that we will have
"peace 
for our time." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it's not true; or at least, not yet. 
</P>
<P>
It has long been a military axiom that you must not get tangled up
trying to 
unravel your opponent's intentions. Instead, you must keep your eyes on 
capabilities. To that end, many intelligent people seem to overlook the
fact 
that Soviet military capabilities continue to grow while their
intentions are 
being slickly packaged to look like democracy in action. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly something is happening in the Soviet Union today. But what it
is, 
what it means and how long it will last are still uncertainties. The
Soviets 
have not dismantled a single military system that they were not bound to
do 
under constraints of treaty. Except in Afghanistan, they have not
withdrawn 
from a single maritime or military position. 
</P>
<P>
It's still a very dangerous world and the threat still threatens. We can
watch 
and hope. But let's keep our heads on straight.

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: KUDOS TO THOSE WHO WERE NICE TO US IN '88 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG, Greenberg is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that 1988 is behind us, it's a good time to acknowledge those who
helped 
make our travel experiences bearable, even enjoyable, last year. Some
awards -- 
not for anyone who has been naughty, but only for those who've been
nice. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Service: Singapore Airlines. Again this airline wins
for 
class, as well as style. It even wins for food, some of which is cooked
to 
order on board. If you like your eggs poached, they'll be poached. 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Service: British Airways. The airline has come a
long way 
from the old business class of coach seats and a few free drinks. Its
new Club 
Class is well recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Virgin Atlantic. The airline's "upper-class"
service is a 
well-kept secret. It's excellent, and equals, if not surpasses, other
airlines' 
first-class sections in terms of passenger space and other goodies, like
a free 
one-way coach ticket for taking just one trip. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Service: Lufthansa. Efficient, courteous and even the meals
are 
thoughtful, with things like fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
Best First-Class Seats: If you want to know the reason why Royal
Jordanian 
Airlines has spent upwards of $10,000 per first-class airline seat, just
sit 
down. These hydraulic electric marvels are truly the closest things to
real 
beds an airline can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rivals to First Class 
</P>
<P>
Best Business-Class Seats: a tie, between Cathay Pacific Airlines and
British 
Airways. Both airlines radically restructured their business class in
1988, and 
a major part of that included removing and redesigning business-class
seats, 
head rests, leg rests and added leg room. And both airlines did almost
too good 
a job in business class. Each is now laboring to make its first class
even 
better, because in many cases the improved business class now rivals
first 
class on some other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Best Coach Seats: No award. In this category, things have actually
gotten 
worse, not better. 
</P>
<P>
Cleanest Planes: Japan Airlines. Its flight attendants come as close to 
providing perfect service as possible. Can you name another airline
where the 
flight attendants rush into the lavatories after each passenger has left
to 
clean them? 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airline: American Airlines. It still has a deserved
reputation 
for consistency of service and one of the best route structures in the
United 
States. It is also an airline that is rapidly expanding to Europe
through new 
U.S. gateways like Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Western Winner 
</P>
<P>
Best Regional Airline: Alaska Airlines. The airline, based in Seattle,
offers 
great in-flight food, good on-time performance, clean airplanes and some
of the 
nicest, most helpful flight attendants I've ever met. In case you
haven't flown 
the airline, Alaska flies to 32 cities in the United States and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airline: a three-way tie among Singapore Airlines,
Thai 
International and SAS. 
</P>
<P>
Best Domestic Airport: a three-way tie. If you define a great airport as
(1) 
convenient, (2) efficient and (3) passenger-friendly, then kudos must go
to the 
airports in Oakland, Kansas City and Tampa. They are distinctly
uncrowded, well 
designed and pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
Best International Airport: Schiphol, in Amsterdam. It defines the word 
efficiency. And, if you like duty-free shopping, this is your place.
Honorable 
mention: Changi Airport in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitarian Travel Award: Doubletree Hotels. Again this year, the
hotel 
chain will provide free short-term lodging for those in need during this 
holiday season. The chain's Room at the Inn program is offered to
individuals 
and families visiting loved ones in out-of-town hospitals, and runs each
year 
from Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mention to Clark Howard, a retired travel agency owner.
Earlier this 
year, Eastern Airlines had a special promotion for its 60th birthday.
The 
offer: People who flew the airline 60 times in 60 days would get 60 free 
tickets. Eastern never thought anyone would take them up on the offer.
But 
Howard did -- and won, then gave the tickets to several charities in
Georgia so 
that local needy children could take their first plane ride as well as
enjoy a 
California vacation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vacation Tips 
</P>
<P>
The Safe Travel Award: Westin Maui. You can thank the hotel, or perhaps
its 
attorneys, for this, but thanks are due to the hotel for providing truly
useful 
information about the sun and surf. In a pamphlet distributed to its
arriving 
guests, the hotel gives specific tanning advice: "Spend a short time in
the sun 
during your first day or two and gradually build up during your stay."
Some 
swimming advice: "Enter the ocean gradually and carefully. Breakers come
in 
'sets' with spells of calm in between." Plus: "Never turn your back to
the 
ocean." If this seems like basic common sense, it is. But remember, most 
visitors to Maui don't live near the water, nor do they enjoy year-round 
sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Hotel Award: a tie, between the Hyatt Key West Hotel and 
Stouffer Hotels and Resorts. Earlier this year, when the Key West
International 
Airport needed a face lift, but there was no county budget for the
project, the 
Hyatt Key West hotel staff donated their time and repainted the
terminal. 
Stouffer wins for abandoning a long-standing rip-off in the hotel
business. The 
chain correctly identified a major traveler complaint, and dropped
surcharges 
on credit-card phone calls, collect calls and calls to toll-free 800
numbers. 
Three cheers to Stouffer; it's about time. Honorable mention to Hyatt
Hotels, 
which has decided against using the more expensive alternative operator
service 
(AOS) to supply its long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
The Thoughtful Airline Award: UTA French Airlines. In order to welcome 
Americans to France, folks who travel on a UTA Holidays trip will
receive a 
"telecard" good for a free four-minute call to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The Freedom of Travel Award: to Japan. An agreement was just reached
between 
the United States and Japan exempting most Americans from needing a visa
to 
visit the country. Now, if we could only afford the visit! 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
And Just for Fun 
</P>
<P>
There are also some unusual award winners: 
</P>
<P>
The 1988 Best Travel Lawsuit Award: to the case of the sunburned buns. A
court 
in Madison, Wis., heard the story of the woman who stayed in the
artificial sun 
a little too long. The woman sued a local tanning salon, claiming she
suffered 
second-degree burns that ruined her vacation in Jamaica by making it
impossible 
to bask on the beach. She won. 
</P>
<P>
And, finally, the 1988 Best Retort to a Lost Travel Lawsuit Award: to
Robert 
Hazard, president and chief executive officer of Quality International.
The 
company was sued by McDonald's after it announced its intention to use
the name 
"McSleep" for a chain of budget hotels. After McDonald's won the suit,
Hazard 
announced the new chain would be called "Jack in the Sack." Actually,
the new 
hotels will be called Sleep Inns. 
</P>
<P>
Merry Christmas.

ONE ENCHANTED DAY WHEN PETER RABBIT STIRRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB O'SULLIVAN, O'Sullivan is a travel writer based in Canoga Park. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in
my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep
in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before
being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is
about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't
a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I
suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I
do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most
awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls
and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . .
a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the
Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick.
He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created
it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the
feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes
dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I
think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned
forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind
of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through
the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage,
where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's
rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it
would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When
you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and
reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling
on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the
area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on
nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and
'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't
spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived
here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just
down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few
dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country
itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have
missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife
recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place.
Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked
us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring
a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose
interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the
house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all
proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot.
Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and
some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't
much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing
the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter
had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories,
a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The
Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and
illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of
languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered,
"but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success,
or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great
deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more
and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world
calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all
of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts
are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under
the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix
Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family.
As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of
us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling
noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and
turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce
nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the
bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head
firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a
glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind
hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife
and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit
would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night
and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his
theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never
had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of
millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to
play in?"

Letter From England 
</P>
<P>
From Mary Evans of Great Britain: "I would dearly love to visit
California, and 
preferably not as a 'package tourist.' So I'm wondering whether any of
your 
readers would like to exchange a holiday with me? I'm a divorced,
Irish-born 
woman in my early 50s. Self-employed and had my own antique shop for
some 
years. Would be delighted to take my exchange visitor out to London,
antique 
shops, country houses and show her (or him) around. I live 45 miles from 
London." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is for the Californian, in turn, to host Mrs. Evans in the
United 
States. Her address: 97 Newport Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes,
England MK17

If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from
cities 
like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as
Tijuana and 
Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal
to 
Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully 
orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in
Moscow, so I 
am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants
her 
eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can
get 
permission.

Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and
Leningrad, 
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian
Republic. 
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv,
Odessa, 
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who 
recently finished studies in the Soviet Union, I can tell you that if
you 
believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.

I want to comment on the letter from Beverly Harlowe, who wrote about
her 
positive experience with customs in Moscow and Leningrad, "Different
Customs" 
(Nov. 27). As a person who is working in the Soviet Union (I am
stateside on 
vacation), I can tell you that what foreigners experience in Leningrad,
Moscow, 
Kiev and other "show" cities is not a true picture. 
</P>
<P>
I work as a translator to an American delegation, so I get to travel
into areas 
where no American has ever set foot. Some of these areas are
strategically 
off-limits to foreigners. Thus, I get to see the Soviet Union as it
really is. 
</P>
<P>
Most of your readers have no idea what the real Soviet Union is like.
They 
spend two weeks in tourist cities and they become instant experts.
Glasnost is 
something that has been developed to appease the Western world. In
reality 
there has been very little change. In cities where Westerners,
particularly 
Americans, are accommodated, a show of glasnost is put on because the
Soviets 
want that image to be taken back to the United States and shared with 
non-travelers.

KUDOS FOR TRAVEL AGENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
Toni Taylor's article, "Agents Take a Beating" (Dec. 11), was the nicest
thing 
that could have been written about the lonely life of a travel agent and
the 
sometimes abuse we get from the travel industry whose livelihood really
depends 
on us. I entered the travel field 41 years ago, and lots of changes have
taken 
place in that time. But never have I read an article that was so concise
and 
informative about the travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
Thank you for printing it. Please thank Toni Taylor for writing it.
Also, 
thanks for providing your readers with an informative travel section.
Without 
it, the public and travel agent would not be as well informed as we are
now.

INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY; 
</P>
<P>
BLIND TWIN BROTHERS GIVE SIGHTLESS RADIO LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF
ROSE 
PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual
wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio
commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast
live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th
birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC,
Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over
the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC
since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under
construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other
sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and
shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the
Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the
radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous
senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the
broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's
"informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information
before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on
Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they
rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips
freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the
lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but
they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually,
it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transcribe Into Braille 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read
aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their
observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared
for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background
information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to
describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that
when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at
people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like
we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and
its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Weekly Program 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and
keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every
Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their
collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee
and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all
high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually
growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in
Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio
Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as
hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s.
They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby,
will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature 
</P>
<P>
They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us
that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes
of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As
with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently
blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep
them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it,"
Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not
negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people
all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

2 AGENCIES STRIVE TO TAKE OVER PEST ABATEMENT IN L.B.

LONG BEACH 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two 
government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would
do a 
better job of combating the city's mosquito population. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito
control in 
the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over 
mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city
Department 
of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health
department 
is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay 
sufficient heed to mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the
suggestion 
that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort
that 
the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with 
error-strewn allegations that the city's equipment, pesticides and
vigilance 
are inferior. 
</P>
<P>
The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito 
umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed 
responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long
Beach 
area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito 
jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Communities Served 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in
the 
district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control," Jack
Hazelrigg, 
the district's assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city
"does a 
good job," Hazelrigg added, "we can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
The district's sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check,
Hazelrigg 
stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with 
unincorporated parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department
of 
Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding
the 
city's mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some
of the 
district's contentions and feels compelled to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they
switched 
to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional
agency, is 
more likely to be responsive to residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district's 
annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding
hearings on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Changes 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I haven't found the city to be wanting," Councilman Ray
Grabinski, 
the committee's chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach
district falls 
under the city's jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided
whether 
any changes were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last
summer 
when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges,
gnat-like, 
flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. "You didn't want
to open 
your mouth to breathe," said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a
neighborhood 
group that complained to the council that the city's bug-control efforts
were 
not all they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito
(district) 
program, we wouldn't have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty
good, 
but it's been on a case-by-case basis," he said, arguing that the health 
department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much
attention to 
mosquito control as does the district. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county
flood 
control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the
district 
will eliminate the midge nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple
of 
dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost
the 
city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety
Committee, 
argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something.
"I'm not 
particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district,"
said 
Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department's
territory. 
He, too, says he is satisfied with the department's mosquito
performance, 
although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito
control 
efforts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito 
program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense
were it 
not used on mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta
complained that 
much of the district's information about the city's program "is simply 
incorrect." For instance, she said that contrary to the district's
assertions, 
the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses 
biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito
larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to
monitor 
mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long
Beach's 
mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over
the third 
of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the
costs of 
that move are being researched.

RESPONSE TIME OF PASADENA POLICE SHORT OF 6-MINUTE GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

PASADENA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A city audit has concluded that police failed to respond to emergency
calls 
within the department goal of six minutes nearly half the time during a
recent 
7-month monitoring period. 
</P>
<P>
A manpower shortage was cited as the reason in the audit by city
administrators 
and outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
The audit also concluded that the Police Department should eliminate two
of its 
four helicopters and consider transferring some of the officers from a
special 
neighborhood crime task force to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
According to the audit, officers did not meet the departmental goal of 
responding within six minutes to crimes that are life-threatening or in 
progress 48% of the time between July, 1987, and February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The average delay was one second more than six minutes. Response times
ranged 
from 3 minutes, 16 seconds to 16 minutes, 26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
During the monitoring period, the department had about 56 officers on
patrol 
and was about 10 below the staffing level approved by the city. 
</P>
<P>
"What I don't understand is why can't we fill those positions?" asked
city 
Director Kathryn Nack. "We have the money, why don't we have the
people?" 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief James M. Robenson said the department has had a difficult
time 
finding officers. 
</P>
<P>
He said it is difficult to find qualified candidates since only about
one in 75 
is accepted. Many potential applicants prefer to work on smaller
suburban 
forces, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena has tried to solve the problem by recruiting on college
campuses 
around the country and setting up a toll-free telephone number to
provide 
employment information, Robenson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said the audit was wrong in assuming the shortage has
affected the 
department's response time to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
He said those calls are given top priority and even if a dozen new
officers 
were hired, it would not significantly lower response times. More patrol 
officers, he said, would have a greater impact on less serious calls,
which are 
sometimes delayed while police respond to emergency calls. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson also said the audit was misleading because it did not count the 
response time of police helicopters, which he said can reach the scene
of any 
crime in the city in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
He added that even if the audit were accurate, a delay of a few seconds
was 
still well within an acceptable range. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure I'd like to have the quickest response of any place, but we're
talking 
about just a few seconds," he said. "If the trend is between six and
seven 
minutes, I feel we're delivering at least what we should." 
</P>
<P>
Police in Pomona, which is comparable to Pasadena in population, has an
average 
response time of 7 minutes, 50 seconds. Pomona has 94 patrol officers. 
</P>
<P>
The audit, which will be presented to the Board of Directors Jan. 10,
was part 
of a series of reports commissioned by the city to study the operation
of all 
its major departments, such as water and power and public works. 
</P>
<P>
The audit largely praised the Police Department for its responsiveness
to the 
community and innovative approach to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
"The Pasadena Police Department can be classified as an organization on
the 
move," the audit stated. "Based on our analysis, the project team found
no 
major efficiency or effectiveness problems." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William Thomson said he was pleased with the results of the audit,
saying 
it confirmed his belief that "we have a first-rate department." 
</P>
<P>
But Director William Paparian said the audit's conclusions led him to
believe 
the department has gotten away from the basics of law enforcement to
pursue 
"sexier" and more high-profile projects. 
</P>
<P>
"We ought to be going to more substance than flash," he said. "We've
gone off 
on these sexy approaches and I think it's time we get back to the
basics." 
</P>
<P>
One example, Paparian said, was the Neighborhood Crime Task Force, a
special 
police unit formed to fight neighborhood crime and drug dealing,
particularly 
in northwest Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The audit praised the task force for its high number of arrests and 
convictions, but noted the number of felony and drug arrests have
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Implications for Task Force 
</P>
<P>
The audit team, which included city administrators and outside
consultants, 
said the smaller number of arrests for serious crimes may be the first
sign the 
3-year-old task force has outlived its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended the department consider transferring some of the
task 
force's 18 officers to other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said cutting back the task force would be a "disservice" to
the 
northwest community, which still has the highest crime rate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
While the number of felony and drug arrests did drop by about 20% during
an 
18-month period ending in 1987, the number of cases filed for
prosecution 
remained the same, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said the task force allows the department to focus on
combatting crime 
in the neighborhoods by freeing up officers for foot patrols throughout
the 
city and undercover drug enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Helicopter Unit 
</P>
<P>
The audit also raised concerns about the efficiency of the department's 
helicopter unit, which auditors said has more helicopters than it needs. 
</P>
<P>
The unit now has four helicopters, one of which is primarily used to
ferry city 
officials and demonstrate the capabilities of helicopters to police
officers. 
Other cities of comparable size have two helicopters to accomplish the
same 
work, according to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why we need to have our own air force with a budget of
$1.1 
million," Paparian said. "I'd like to see us spend that money on 
bread-and-butter stuff like more neighborhood patrols." 
</P>
<P>
The audit recommended selling two of the helicopters for an annual
savings of 
as much as $640,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Robenson said to achieve those savings the department would have to 
eliminate daytime flights and cut back flight time from 3,750 hours a
year to 
1,170. 
</P>
<P>
He said the department is spending about the same as other departments
that 
have just two helicopters. For example, he said, Riverside police spent
$1.3 
million and Newport police spent $900,000 last year to operate two
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
Robenson said having four helicopters is critical to the department's
patrol 
strategy because they can reach the scene of a crime faster than a
patrol car 
and can cover much more territory.

SANTA FE SPRINGS FIRMS CREATE AID NETWORK UNDER EMERGENCY PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987,
finally 
settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city's
3,500 
businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical
problems. The 
nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged
streets for 
hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to
travel 
about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications were terrible," Wilson said. "We were overwhelmed. We
really 
had no idea what was going on in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially
important 
in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the
numbers of 
people" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. "And if
this 
were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with
substantial 
damage and not be aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partnership Formed 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa
Fe 
Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness
plan that 
would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses
establish 
their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and
in the 
past year the chamber's suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan.
Though 
supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of
the city 
when disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the
best 
option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven
square 
miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara,
a 
supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The
institute is a 
division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a
committee 
of city and chamber officials prepare the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The city told the businesses, 'We don't have the traditional support
systems. 
So you are it,' " Ferrara said. "This was a tremendous buy-in on the
part of 
industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far
as their 
association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use
of what 
they have, and what they have is industry." 
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake were to happen once the city's plan is in place, this
is how 
businesses would respond: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Command Posts 
</P>
<P>
They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an
area 
coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio.
Workers on 
foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured 
employees or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where 
emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food
warehouse 
might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or
plywood 
for boarding up broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands,"
Latham 
said. "It's really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls
for 
businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using
propane 
might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would
include 
a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
"An important element is getting the businesses running again," Wilson
said. 
"They're producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government
disaster 
assistance loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said
the 
plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are
willing to 
share them," Landis said. "We're going to wind up with a business
community 
that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge
of 
emergency preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
It will be about three years before the system is completely in place,
Latham 
said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa
Fe 
Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining
information 
about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant
facts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and 
command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in
disaster loan 
procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs
will 
assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson
said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community,
has asked 
city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for
residential 
areas, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs' business network can become a model
for 
other cities and counties with large industrial bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of 
communication and support," Latham said, "so when an emergency does
occur, the 
relationships will automatically be in place."

REVIEWING THE 'CITY HALL CIRCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to The Times for printing the facts objectively about the mess in
Long 
Beach resulting from unrestrained and unplanned development! 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is "plenty of
blame 
to go around" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family 
dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City 
Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is
plenty 
of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall,
who 
managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster 
simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed
by Kell, 
Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora's box of
noise 
and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in
the 
direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our 
council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and
trying to 
expand one in a prime residential section of our city! 
</P>
<P>
One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a
"solution" 
from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want
to 
harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who
cause 
probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem ("Long Beach Thinks
Again 
About Paving of Greenbelt," Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to
flail 
around while giving the superficial impression of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be
unduly 
charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight 
focused; it may perchance do some good.

SIGHTLESS TWINS GIVE LISTENERS A DIFFERENT VIEW OF ROSE PARADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY BARBER, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While millions watch as television personalities describe the visual
wonders 
passing before them in Pasadena on Monday, a pair of blind radio
commentators 
will offer their own view of the Tournament of Roses. 
</P>
<P>
John and Larry Gassman, who have never seen the parade, will broadcast
live for 
the third time from high in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
The Whittier twins, who coincidentally will celebrate their 34th
birthday 
Monday, will begin their coverage of the parade at 8 a.m. on KPCC,
Pasadena 
City College's radio station, a program that will be carried all over
the 
country via satellite. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sighted Listeners, Too 
</P>
<P>
Experienced broadcasters who have had their own 2-hour show on KPCC
since 1980, 
the men do their parade commentary especially for a blind audience. 
</P>
<P>
After much preparation, including "feeling tours" of floats under
construction, 
they describe the parade in terms that are understandable to other
sightless 
people. They often refer to textures of float materials and to sizes and
shapes 
they have felt. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Shirk, program director of KPCC who also serves as the
Gassmans' 
spotter during the parade, said plenty of sighted people listen as well. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had so many people say they get sick and tired of the patter on 
television, and they turn down the sound on their sets and turn on the
radio," 
Shirk said. He called the twins "extremely intelligent, with marvelous
senses 
of humor.' 
</P>
<P>
Shirk said about 30 other public radio stations usually pick up the
broadcast 
via satellite. KPCC is at 89.3 on FM radio and is the parade's
"informational" 
station, Shirk said, giving weather, parking and traffic information
before and 
after the parade broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
As on the past two New Year's Days, the twins will climb 65 feet to the 
broadcasting booth before 6 a.m. Monday. While others look down on
Orange Grove 
and Colorado Boulevards through early morning darkness and frost, they
rub 
their freezing fingertips across pages of Braille notes. 
</P>
<P>
Citing their biggest problem, John Gassman said, "When our fingertips
freeze, 
the Braille becomes fuzzy. That's like reading a printed page and the
lights go 
out. We tried last year to wear gloves with the fingertips cut out, but
they 
still froze. Now we're going to try a portable lamp with heat. Actually,
it's 
fun to figure out what to do." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the parade, the men tape press releases that are read
aloud 
and then transcribe the tapes into Braille. Then they tape their
observations 
while they tour the floats, literally getting a feel of their sizes and 
textures. In combining all of the material, they said they are prepared
for 
every possible delay or mishap and always have much more background
information 
and details than they have ever needed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Acting as Spotter 
</P>
<P>
In acting as spotter, Shirk joins them in their broadcast booth to
describe 
anything that might occur in the parade that is not in the official
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
"He tells us to speed up or slow down," John said. "Anyone knows that
when 
you're describing a float and a band goes by, there's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
They said their style is to talk to each other during the broadcast, 
questioning and answering to "keep it conversational." 
</P>
<P>
"We want to be talking to people, not at them," John said. "Talking at
people 
is an easy trap to fall into. We try to stay away from sounding like
we're 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
"If we use humor, it's not conscious, but if there's something funny and
its in 
good taste, well. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
They have had years of practice, anticipating each other's comments and
keeping 
up a lively patter. 
</P>
<P>
Their weekly radio show, "Same Time, Same Station," is on KPCC every
Sunday 
from 6 to 8 p.m., when they replay old radio programs from their
collection of 
13,000 that include Jack Benny, Bob Hope, "Suspense" and "Fibber McGee
and 
Molly." Sometimes they interview writers or directors of the shows. 
</P>
<P>
Their collection is what John called "medium-sized, but all
high-quality" 
recordings of the old programs. It began as a hobby and is continually
growing 
as the men buy and trade with other collectors all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
They are identical twins who live together in their own home in
Whittier, where 
they grew up and attended public schools. They are graduates of Rio
Hondo 
College, where their interest in radio began when they began serving as
hosts 
of a "Top 40s" show on the college radio station in the early 1970s.
They are 
not employed, but hope their interest in radio, which is now a hobby,
will lead 
to jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Nature

They said their parents, both of whom have died, "purposely taught us
that we 
were just like anyone else, so being blind was just second nature." 
</P>
<P>
They were born more than two months premature, and within three minutes
of each 
other, John weighing 1 pound, 8 ounces, and Larry 1 pound, 10 ounces. As
with 
many premature babies born during the 1950s, they were permanently
blinded by 
excessive amounts of oxygen pumped into their incubators to help keep
them 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
"We've never been anything but blind, so we never thought about it,"
Larry 
said. "We just learned to adapt and make the best of it. We're not
negative 
people anyway." 
</P>
<P>
They said they have had responses to their parade commentary from people
all 
over the country, not all of them blind. 
</P>
<P>
"No negative feedback, as far as we know," John said.

LONG BEACH URGED TO HELP HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe for the New Year . . . the Long Beach city administration might .
. . 
officially help the homeless in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
As an article in the Long Beach section showed (Times, Dec. 22), local 
restaurants, such as Vincent Williams' Golden Bird chicken outlets,
donate food 
to the Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants such as Justina's in downtown Long Beach, Domino's
Pizza and 
Twin Wheels Steak House have jumped on the bandwagon in giving food to
the Long 
Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So when will the Long Beach City Council . . . jump on the bandwagon and
take 
official action to help the homeless as recommended by the city's task
force in 
1987? Will they do something in early 1989?

SUPER QUIZ DROPS 'CRUSOE' AFTER RACISM COMPLAINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Robinson Crusoe" has been thrown overboard by the planners of the Los
Angeles 
Unified School District's Sixth Annual Academic Pentathlon after a
teacher 
complained about racial stereotyping in the literary classic. 
</P>
<P>
In October the district notified coaches preparing middle-school
students for 
the districtwide academic competition that the Super Quiz would deal
with 
Daniel Defoe's 18th-Century novel about shipwreck and survival. A few
weeks 
later, the coaches were sent a memo saying the book had been withdrawn
and 
replaced by Jules Verne's classic "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea." No
reason was 
given for the change. 
</P>
<P>
According to Lorna Round, the district's associate superintendent of 
instruction, the Defoe book was dropped from the pentathlon after a
coach in a 
predominantly black school objected to "the blatantly racist attitude
pervasive 
throughout the book." Round declined to identify the coach, who is on
winter 
break, without first obtaining his permission. 
</P>
<P>
Round said the coach had objected to passages such as the following
description 
of Friday, the black man who ends Crusoe's decades of isolation: "He was
a 
comely handsome fellow perfectly well made. . . . His hair was long and
black, 
not curled like wool. . . . The color of his skin was not quite black .
. . and 
yet not of an ugly yellow, nauseous tawny as the Brazilians . . . his
nose 
small, not flat like the Negroes." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Pulled From Shelves 
</P>
<P>
Round said the staff agreed with the coach's contention that "a book
which 
reinforces negative racial stereotypes should not be the centerpiece of
a 
districtwide competition." Round emphasized that the book had not been
pulled 
from library shelves nor censored in any other way, only dropped from
the list 
of material to be used in the competition. The pentathlon will be held
Feb. 25 
at Fairfax High School. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not saying 'Don't read it,' " Round said. However, she said she
and 
other staff members felt that, given the uncomplimentary
characterization of 
blacks and other minorities in the book, it needed to be taught
carefully. A 
specific concern, she said, was that the book's treatment of minorities
might 
negatively affect the self-esteem of some minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Given the deadline imposed by the competition, she said, "we didn't feel
we had 
time to talk to all the teachers (about ways the book might be
constructively 
taught)." Round said the district hoped to develop a lesson plan for the
book 
that would address the troublesome issues it raises. 
</P>
<P>
A few coaches called the district to protest the change in books, Round
said. 
Most were distressed because they had already begun working with their
students 
on "Robinson Crusoe." 
</P>
<P>
Both books are recommended for study by middle-school students by the
state 
Department of Education. Janet R. Cole, a state education official,
lauded the 
district for its handling of the matter. "I think it's wonderful that
they are 
sensitive to the community. Both are excellent books. It doesn't matter
which 
one they use."

SHOP OWNERS ARE PIONEERS IN REVIVING OLD WEST STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
MONTEREY FURNITURE RIDES BACK OUT OF SUNSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEG SULLIVAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is
not 
cheesy: It's Monterey, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
What? You don't remember the style of furniture that filled
working-class Los 
Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and '40s, spread East with the lore of 
Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room? 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura 
antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey
furniture, 
which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys,
flowers and 
sombrero-bedecked figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to
light," 
explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East
Thompson 
Boulevard with Fisher, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Style 
</P>
<P>
Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made
furniture 
that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as "a motion-picture version of
what 
cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had
furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research
and 
promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the
couple's 
colleagues agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and
Dee," 
said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded
in the 
furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western
influences. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living
quarters 
and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of
dining 
room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at
least 
three photographs of Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at
"openings" 
in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of
Monterey 
furniture as Rogers' 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz
cowboy 
furniture. "Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture,
Pottery and 
Art" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage
Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Introduction 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition enhanced the furniture's status as a collectible by
popularizing 
it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp,
a 
curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to
include it in 
an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous," Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a
canvas 
canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned
out of 
wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a
mountain 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute.
Magazines 
such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised
Monterey 
furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop
even 
peddles modern-day reproductions of it. 
</P>
<P>
The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line,
George 
Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of
making 
couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and
lately 
his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paintings Exhibited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the
folksy 
paintings at their store. Mason's painted renditions of Monterey
furniture sold 
briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed
for his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand," gushed Patricia
Slater, 
53, a designer of what she described as "cowboy punk" furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the
Los 
Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of
Barker 
Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that
would 
bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all
over 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in
the 
background of a Warner Brothers movie, "Old Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120
pieces, 
each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host
of 
copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Times 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a
grinding 
halt. After the war, tastes changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass," said Betty Gold, who
stocked 
her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with
Monterey 
purchased from Shorts and Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, "grist for
garage 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history
teacher in 
Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old 
paintings and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout 
Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention.
Typically 
decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or
leading 
stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a '30s Southern California child and have never outgrown it," he
said. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the 
knickknacks he was acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it
would 
sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal 
exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then,
sales 
have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and 
secondhand stores to replenish his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was
selling. He 
had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label --
"Monterey" 
-- but unraveling their origins proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No,
another 
said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that
notion 
to rest. "Oh, that's what we call Carmel furniture," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that
Shorts 
had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded
that 
the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Noted 
</P>
<P>
Mason, the furniture's real manufacturer, noted the error when he read
an 
article about the Santa Monica exhibition. "It made me so angry,"
remembers 
Mason, who complained to the museum's director, Tobi Smith. She was only
too 
happy to hear from him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming
catalogue 
of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith's husband, Bob,
the 
Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "My Mexicana Nirvana," Bob Smith's piece hails the furniture as
"a 
unique manifestation of Western urban culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey
furniture 
is synonymous with Southern Californians' collective search for a
meaningful 
identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common," he
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to
Monterey 
because it tickles the modern fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says
it's all 
right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it," he
said. 
And "Monterey Furniture is honestly fake." 
</P>
<P>
Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells
for 
$3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine
chair 
from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason
remembers 
the same pieces selling for originally. 
</P>
<P>
But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He
says 
the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so
prevalent in 
Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he
and 
his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of '50s furnishings
with 
Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they
recently 
divorced, he said he "got custody" of the furniture, which now decorates
his 
Spanish Revival apartment in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gloria List's clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica "find
it 
garish and klutzy," she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey's
quirky 
style. Two of Shorts' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed
out 
their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes.
After 
returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First
he 
represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold
Colonial 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an unhappy guy," he said.

STATE DROPS THREAT TO FINE WHITTIER ON WASTE MISHAP 
</P>

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The state has dropped its threat to fine the city up to $30,000 in
connection 
with a June mishap at a household toxic-waste roundup after city
officials 
warned that they would refuse to hold more roundups. 
</P>
<P>
The state Department of Health Services cited Whittier for s and
gynecology 
at USC School of Medicine, has been named president of the medical and
dental 
staff of Huntmixing several types of acids together. By law, the state
should have 
been notified within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Marxen, a spokesman for the Department of Health Services, said the
state 
decided against the fine because it might scare off other cities
conducting 
toxic-waste roundups. In such roundups residents dispose of household
chemicals 
such as paint thinners and insecticides. About 400 households
participated in 
Whittier's roundup. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not after the money," Marxen said. "What we're after is having
them 
comply with the law and understand that they have violated the law. . .
. The 
public airing of their fault was felt to be enough of a punishment." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City's Position 
</P>
<P>
Michael Woods, an attorney who handled the case for Whittier, said the
city was 
"not simply going to roll over" and take the fine. The city's position
has been 
that any fine as a result of the accident should be paid by the
contractor, 
Omega Recovery Services, which was paid $60,000 for the job, Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
City officials also told the state that if Whittier were fined, the city
would 
refuse to conduct any more toxic roundups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the city was going to end up getting slapped with a fine for its 
responsible effort (to hold the roundup), then why take that risk?"
Woods 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
In an out-of-court settlement of the issue, city officials agreed to: 
</P>
<P>
Make presentations to other cities in the Los Angeles area about the
correct 
way to run a household toxic-waste roundup; 
</P>
<P>
Provide extra training over the next eight months to city employees
involved in 
handling hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
Send theWhittier, said the city was 
"not simply going to roll over" and take the fine. The city's position
has been 
al at least 60 days before any future roundup. The state 
normally requires only 30-days' notice from agencies who want to
organize such 
events. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Going to Be Watching' 
</P>
<P>
"This is just as serious as when we were talking about the fine,"
Marxen, the 
health services spokesman, said of the agreement. "We're going to be
watching 
(Whittier officials) pretty closely in the future because of their track 
record." 
</P>
<P>
During the roundup, Dennis O'Meara of Omega Recovery Services mixed
several 
types of potent nitric acid in a 55-gallon drum. O'Meara, who was not
wearing 
the proper protective clothing, was treated at a hospital after his face
and 
arms were burned. 
</P>
<P>
After the citation was reported in news accounts, the city fired Tom
Bayles, 
the assistant public services director responsible for hazardous waste 
disposal.

President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe
by 
delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the 
European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had
made the 
traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged
France's 
11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying:
"Only a 
Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival
Japan and 
the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head
before 
the powers that dominate the world."

Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing
charges as 
125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear
power 
plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission 
branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last
week the 
plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four
months. 
The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from
operating. 
Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that
would have 
permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.

<TEXT>
<P>
Bewildered friends and followers would recall that he looked tired and 
depressed, still grief-stricken and mystified over the savage assault on
his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than a week had passed since he found her comatose on the
garage 
floor, choked senseless and left for dead. She had not regained
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
Now, in the early evening hours of April 30, 1987, the intense, balding
man 
excused himself and disappeared into a private hospital suite. 
</P>
<P>
He locked and chained the door, sat down with pen and paper and began
composing 
a chilling letter. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a demon inside my soul," he wrote. "It has always been there.
My 
demon tries to lead me down paths I do not want to follow. At times that
demon 
has lured me into doing things I do not want to do. 
</P>
<P>
". . . My demon has finally gotten the upper hand." 
</P>
<P>
When security officers broke in the next morning, they found him
sprawled 
across the bed. He was alive but unconscious and in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby were empty bottles of prescription drugs and his rambling letter,
which 
began with instructions for his funeral and ended thusly: 
</P>
<P>
"I have finally made the decision to take care of myself. I have grown
weak. 
God has remained strong. Therein lies your hope. I have none. 
</P>
<P>
"Walker L. Railey." 
</P>
<P>
The vicious attack on Walker Railey's wife and his ensuing suicide
attempt 
devastated three families, split a church and outraged a city. 
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemaker, and her husband
was 
perhaps Dallas' most dynamic and socially conscious young minister. At
39, 
Walker Railey reigned as the senior pastor of the city's 6,000-member
First 
United Methodist Church and loomed as a rising star in his mainstream 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
The news of the suicide attempt swept through town, nowhere more
devastatingly 
than at First Methodist, where Railey's flock was already reeling from
the 
attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Keep Him in Our Prayers' 
</P>
<P>
His chief assistant, the Rev. Gordon Casad, told the congregation the
next 
Sunday, "We must remember our pastor and the troubling of his mind and
spirit 
and keep him in our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if Railey was now a suspect, Park Stearns, supervisor in the
Dallas FBI 
office, replied: "This is a big no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Although police refused to reaged a city. 
</P>
<P>
For Peggy Railey was by no means an ordinary homemakeide note. And they
redoubled their efforts to 
review with the convalescing minister what happened the night his wife
was 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
A fellow pastor, the Rev. David Shawyer of Plymouth Park Methodist
Church, 
said, "I'm praying that it is not what it looks like. I'm praying that
what the 
police are suggesting could never be true. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm praying this will all come out some other way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Latest Twist in Mystery 
</P>
<P>
Railey's attempt on his own life was only the latest twist in what would
be 
called Dallas' most haunting and sensational mystery in a decade. One 
unrestrained commentator called the attempted murder the city's most 
extraordinary crime since the assassination of President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey survived, but only barely so. Comatose, she could not
identify her 
assailant. 
</P>
<P>
Several anonymous, typewritten death threats preceded the attack,
apparently 
provoked by Railey's strong sermons and public statements against racial 
prejudice and injustice. But friends said Peggy Railey did not frighten
easily, 
and she had encouraged her husband not to soften his stand. 
</P>
<P>
The last letter was slipped under the door of a church office just prior
to 
Easter Sunday services. It said: "EASTER IS WHEN CHRIST AROSE, BUT YOU
ARE 
GOING DOWN." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wore Bulletproof Vest 
</P>
<P>
Under the stern scrutiny of security officers, Railey delivered his
Easter 
sermon wearing a bulletproof vest beneath his robes. 
</P>
<P>
It would be his last appearance in the pulpit of First Methodist's
historic old 
sanctuary. He hammered the congregation with a theme of death and
resurrection 
that morning. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he said, pointing his finger at parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to die," he repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Police and church officials first theorized that the attempt on Peggy
Railey's 
life was some kind of grotesque retaliation for her husband's
outspokenness. 
</P>
<P>
With his wife in critical condition, Railey stationed himself outside
her 
hospital room, interrupting his vigil only for a trip downtown to give 
investigators an account of his activities the night of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noticed Open Garage Door 
</P>
<P>
He said he'd spent the evening doing research at Southern Methodist
University 
libraries. Returning home about 12:40 a.m., he said, he noticed that a
door to 
the darkened two-car garage was partly open. 
</P>
<P>
Driving inside with his headlights on, he found his wife lying on the
floor, 
writhing in convulsions. Her face was puffy and discolored and she was
frothing 
at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
He said the children, Ryan, 5, and Megan, 2, were going to die," he
repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to die." 
</P>
<P>
Poohn Holt, 37, the tall, sandy-haired supervisor of 
crimes against persons, told reporters the questioning was routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any indicators that would point to him as a suspect," he
said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Arranged for Hospitalil only for a trip downtown to give 
investigators an account of his activities the night of April e day
greeting a parade of visitors who expressed shock, sorrow and support. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who came to share their grief that day was a striking
frosted 
blonde who carried a single red rose and disappeared into Railey's
hospital 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
With the investigation in full swing and the FBI trying to identify the
source 
of the death threats, Railey continued his hospital vigil under heavy
police 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just numb. . . . He's overwhelmed by it," said Ralph Shannon, a
longtime 
church member. 
</P>
<P>
If Railey was silent, his ministerial colleagues were not. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Joseph Ofseyer of Congregation Shearith Israel said that Railey
had 
suffered for his message of justice and equality but that the religious 
community would not "be cowed into silence" and "permit such a person to
stand 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost or overlooked in the outcry was an observation by Police Lt.
Ron 
Waldrop that the abusive letters appeared to be the work of one
individual and 
not the concerted effort of a white supremacist group. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no central theme," he added. 
</P>
<P>
A short time later, the FBI determined that the death threats had been
written 
on an office typewriter at First Methodist. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey's rise to clerical prominence seemed almost preordained
from his 
turbulent childhood days in Owensboro, Ky., a coal mining town on the
south 
bank of the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of three children, Railey grew up a nonsmoker and nondrinker
who 
delivered his first sermon at age 17 and became something of a circuit
preacher 
while a history major at Western Kentucky University. 
</P>
<P>
He attended Vanderbilt Divinity School for a year, then headed to Dallas
and 
the Perkins Theological Seminary at Southern Methodist University. 
</P>
<P>
It was there, in 1970, that he met Margaret Nicolai, an equally
talented, 
intelligent and religiously dedicated young musician whom everyone
called 
Peggy. She had arrived at SMU from Wisconsin to pursue a master's degree
in 
organ music. 
</P>
<P>
Acquaintances say Peggy recognized early on that young Walker was a man
with 
great ambition and potential but that she was not much taken with him 
romantically. His persistence won her over and the couple were married
in 
August, 1971. 
</P>
<P>
After obtaining a doctor of ministry in 1973, Railey ministered to
several 
rural churches in Oklahoma and then was appointed an associate pastor at
First 
Methodist in Dallas. In 1980, after a stint as a senior minister at a
suburban 
Dallas church, he returned to First Methodist as senior pastor at age
33. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eight Ministers Became Bishops 
</P>
<P>
The appointment was the most dramatic step in a meteoric rise. Although
not 
even the largest Methodist church in Dallas, First Methodist had the
reputation 
as the nation's mother church of Methodism, in no small part because
eight of 
its ministers had gone on to become bishops. 
</P>
<P>
Under Railey's leadership, First Methodist grew and prospered, its
membership 
approaching 6,000 and its annual budget doubling to $2 million. And
although 
Railey himself was short, balding and physically unimposing, his radiant 
ministry served as a magnet for the young, energetic and socially
conscious 
while not alienating older, more conservative parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
He spoke out boldly against those who practiced or condoned racial
intolerance. 
He clashed with a City Council member over what he perceived to be a
racist 
stance on illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
He challenged President Reagan to take a "more visible and articulate
stand" 
for peace and he once said of fundamentalist Jerry Falwell, "I guarantee
he 
doesn't speak for the Kingdom of God, let alone the people in it." 
</P>
<P>
When the threats came, the Raileys seemed to take them in stride. The
FBI 
encouraged Peggy Railey and the children to leave town for a while.
Although 
she went to her parents' home for four days, she did not seem overly
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Diane Yarrington, wife of First Methodist's minister of music and one of
Peggy 
Railey's closest friends, said Peggy told her that she and Walker were
taking 
precautions but that they refused to be intimidated. 
</P>
<P>
Long before the attack, the Yarringtons and Raileys pledged to care for
one 
another's children in the event of tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
That pledge would soon come due. 
</P>
<P>
As Railey and his wife lay near death in the same intensive care unit,
police 
were anxious to talk again with First Methodist's senior pastor. After
his 
first interview, police found unspecified "inconsistencies" in Railey's
account 
of April 21. 
</P>
<P>
Friends in the church hired a tough, no-nonsense criminal defense
attorney 
named Doug Mulder to advise Railey, and as the minister recovered, he
wasn't 
talking to police. 
</P>
<P>
He did, however, speak with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
"To be honest with you . . . I just don't know anything," he told a
veteran 
religion reporter. 
</P>
<P>
Later, he told the Associated Press: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't attack my wife. I didn't plan to have someone attack my wife.
I 
didn't orchestrate a plan to attack my wife. And if I had written the
letters, 
I wouldn't have written them on a typewriter in the church. But I didn't
write 
them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Don't Understand Why' 
</P>
<P>
He could not rationalize his suicide attempt, which he knew was
construed by 
some as an admission of guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why I did it, any more than I understand why I lived
beyond 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that
Railey did 
not try to kill his wife. Presumably because of those results, Mulder
approved 
a police-administered examination the next day. That exercise was
described as 
"inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
"The results showed that he didn't have anything to do with the attack,
nor did 
he conspire with anyone," Mulder said. 
</P>
<P>
Though Railey's followers took new heart, investigators were unimpressed
and 
restated the ongoing request to interview him. 
</P>
<P>
Holt accused Mulder of misrepresenting the outcome of the
police-administered 
examination. He suggested that some of Railey's responses were
"untruthful," 
but refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
All but overlooked in the flap over the polygraphs was an unattributed
police 
statement that Railey's account of his activities the night of April 21
was "in 
direct conflict with indisputab</P>
<P>
Mulder arranged for a private polygraph test, which indicated that
Railey did 
not try to kling eyes was no stranger to the congregation 
at First United Methodist Church. Lucy Papillon grew up in the
magnificent 
sanctuary, the daughter of the Rev. Robert E. Goodrich Jr., a former
senior 
pastor and later a Methodist bishop. 
</P>
<P>
A portrait of Goodrich, who died in 1985, hangs in the First Methodist
foyer. 
</P>
<P>
"She had that knotted Goodrich chin, his thin, drawn smile, and the dark
eyes 
that were his most distinctive feature -- eyes that seemed remote but
also 
searching and intelligent," journalist Larry Wright, a childhood
acquaintance, 
wrote in Texas Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a strong face, like her father's, and if in some lights it
appeared 
hard, in others you could detect a vulnerable and even wounded soul who
had 
lived past the point where life surprised her." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Lucy played the piano in Sunday school and was a
cheerleader at 
an exclusive girls' school. She entered Southern Methodist University in
1959 
to pursue a degree in music education and, four years later, married a 
Methodist preacher. They were divorced in 1973 after she bore two sons. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worked Variety of Jobs 
</P>
<P>
Friends say she worked at a variety of jobs, including a stint as a
part-time 
model. Somewhere along the way she became enamored with psychology. She
married 
and divorced again and, in 1982, received a doctorate in psychology and
moved 
to California to complete her training. She found various jobs in her
new field 
there and reportedly began to visit the Esalen commune. 
</P>
<P>
And it was there that Lucy decided to take on her identity as
"Papillon," 
French for butterfly. In 1986 she opened a private psychology practice
in 
Dallas and legally changed her name to Lucy Papillon. 
</P>
<P>
On July 14, 1987, Dallas County's chief prosecutor sat down with police
and the 
FBI and heard for the first time all the facts of the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Challenged to 'Talk or Walk' 
</P>
<P>
His face flushed with anger, his thick mustache almost bristling, Norm
Kinne, 
53, stormed from the meeting room into a cluster of reporters and
challenged 
Walker Railey, as one headline proclaimed, to "talk or walk." 
</P>
<P>
Eyes flashing and his finger jabbing at the nearest of four television
cameras, 
Kinne declared: 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of this man fooling with the justice system and the life of
his 
wife. . . . I'm going to tell you, Walker Railey, I'm tired of you
messing with 
the Dallas Police Department, and you're going to come before the Dallas
County 
grand jury and you're going to clear up these discrepancies, or you're
going to 
leave the country!" 
</P>
<P>
Kinne could subpoena Railey to appear before grand jurors, but he had no
way to 
compel him to answer questions if he invoked the constitutional
protection 
against self-incrimination. Nor was it in the fiery prosecutor's domain
to 
order a reticent Railey out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Photographs Triggered Outburst 
</P>
<P>
But at that moment, nobody was foolhardy enough to argue the issue with
Kinne. 
</P>
<P>
Later that evening, a vaguely contrite Kinne said it was the photographs
of 
Peggy Railey after the attack that so outraged him and triggered the
outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"I got irritated because we have a lady here who is a loving wife and
mother 
and who is lying in a hospital more dead than alive," he said. "And we
have an 
alleged pillar of the community who will not talk to us about this." 
</P>
<P>
Six days before Kinne's outburst, a Dallas Morning News story linked
Lucy 
Papillon to the Railey case, calling her a potential "reluctant
witness." 
</P>
<P>
The article said mobile telephone records revealed that Railey called
Papillon 
twice the night of the attack. Railey had neglected to mention those
calls in 
his lengthy interview with police the morning after April 21. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Two Calls Placed to Home 
</P>
<P>
Phone records also showed that Railey placed two calls to his own home
between 
midnight and 12:30 a.m., the last one about 10 minutes before he
reported 
finding his wife near death on the garage floor. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators refused to discuss the significance of the mobile phone
records 
but it seemed safe to assume they somehow represented the "indisputable 
evidence" of inconsistencies in Railey's story. 
</P>
<P>
Later, on the eve of a grand jury meeting on the Railey case, the
Morning News 
reported that Railey had visited Papillon the night his wife was
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the jury room, Kinne was eager to confront Railey, although he
was 
certain that the embattled minister would refuse to answer questions and
invoke 
his Fifth Amendment rights. Railey took the Fifth -- 43 times. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Knew Nothing About Attack 
</P>
<P>
"I have followed the advice of my lawyer consistently and will
consistently do 
that," Railey remarked brusquely when he emerged from the closed-door
session. 
</P>
<P>
Papillon spent an hour before the panel and, according to her attorney,
Phil 
Burleson, answered every question. She knew nothing about the attack,
Burleson 
said, and then cautioned reporters against drawing conclusions that his
client 
was romantically linked with Railey. 
</P>
<P>
But it made no difference. Leaks poured out of the grand jury room that
Lucy 
Papillon was Walker Railey's mistress. 
</P>
<P>
According to those present, Papillon told grand jurors she first met
Railey on 
a religious television show and they became romantically involved in
June, 
1986, about the same time she changed her name. She said she had
accompanied 
Railey on several ministerial trips and had vacationed with him in
California. 
</P>
<P>
Nor were their liaisons confined to this country. Papillon revealed that
Railey 
stopped over for a prearranged rendezvous in London while returning from
a 
World Methodist Council meeting in Nairobi, Kenya, in July, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
In one particularly chilling disclosure, Lucy said they embraced and
kissed in 
Walker's hospital suite while Peggy lay near death nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the sensational revelations, the grand jury testimony raised
almost as 
many questions as it answered. And the "indisputable evidence" remained
cloaked 
in secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
"We still have a lot of discrepancies, but we're not going to discuss
them," 
said Police Lt. Waldrop. "There is no statue of limitations on attempted 
murder, and that's how long we'll be working on it." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the discrepancies and the indisputable evidence did unfold. 
</P>
<P>
On the night of the attack, Railey made several calls from a cellular
telephone 
installed in his car at church expense only hours earlier as a security
measure 
because of anonymous threats. A phone company computer recorded the
times. 
</P>
<P>
Railey called home at 5:55 p.m. to say he was leaving the office. At
5:58 p.m., 
he telephoned Papillon and talked for one minute. 
</P>
<P>
Arriving home shortly before 6:30 p.m., Railey said he found his wife
working 
on a faulty garage door lock with a bar of soap. Investigators later
found no 
trace of soap on the lock, which was working fine. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he sat on the hood of his wife's Chrysler and talked with
her for 
several minutes. He told her he intended to spend the evening on a
research 
project at the SMU libraries. He did not change from his business suit
and left 
the house a little after 6:30. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:38 p.m., Railey, who never wore a watch, called on the car phone
for the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
He said he spent half an hour or so at SMU's Bridwell Library and was
back in 
his car by 7:26 p.m., at which time he phoned the family baby-sitter and 
discussed plans for a trip to San Antonio the Raileys planned later in
the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
At 7:32 p.m., he phoned Papillon at her home near SMU. He drove directly
to her 
house, where he spent the next 40 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Went Back to Library 
</P>
<P>
Railey told a friend later he went there to get some relaxation tapes to
help 
relieve stress. 
</P>
<P>
From 8 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., Railey was back at Bridwell, where he asked a 
librarian what time the library closed. At 8:30, Railey, using a pay
phone, 
called home on a private line. Peggy Railey told him she was putting the 
children to bed. She then called her parents long distance in Tyler and
talked 
from 8:49 p.m. until 9:14 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 8:53 p.m., Raily bought gas at a Texaco station near campus. After
drinking 
a wine cooler, he said, he returned to Fondren Library, SMU's main
library. But 
no one saw him there until after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
At 9:30 p.m., a jogger in the Raileys' neighborhood spotted a man in a
business 
suit and street shoes running through a yard south of the Railey home.
Between 
10:15 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a neighbor heard rustling sounds in the alley
behind 
the home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Leave Business Card 
</P>
<P>
Sometime after 11 p.m., a librarian saw Railey at Fondren. Upon leaving
at 
midnight, he attempted to give his business card to a student at the
checkout 
desk. On the back of the card was a message requesting help in finding
research 
information. Railey also noted the time, 10:30 p.m., when in fact it was 
midnight, the student told police. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:03 a.m., Railey called home on the car phone, but this time he
used the 
public line. According to friends, the family seldom answered the public
line, 
which was connected to an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he said. "I'm calling you from my mobile phone. Peg, it's
about, 
oh, I don't know. I don't have a watch. It's somewhere between 10:30 and
10:45, 
somewhere along in there. I worked at Bridwell until they closed and now
I'm 
going to Fondren." 
</P>
<P>
This could not have been true. He had in fact just left Fondren,
according to 
other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Lock the Garage Door' 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be in about 1. If you want to, go ahead and lock the garage door
and I'll 
park out front. It really doesn't matter to me at this point. My concern
is 
that you're safe. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
This portion of the tape might explain why Peggy Railey would enter the
garage 
that night. Even so, Railey would still have to explain why, if he
really 
intended to speak with his wife, he had called on the public line and
left a 
message. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three minutes later, Railey phoned the answering machine again,
and on 
this occasion gave the correct time: 12:29. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Babe," he began. "It's 12:29 and I'm on the way home from SMU. . .
. 
Everything really went well. I got a lot accomplished. I had to leave my
card 
with the reference librarian because there was one deal that I couldn't
quite 
work out. I'm not calling on the private line because I know you're
already 
asleep, but in case you get up with the kids, I just wanted you to know
that 
I'm on my way home. It's 12:30. I'll be home about 12:45. 
</P>
<P>
"Love you. Bye-bye." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Sign of a Struggle 
</P>
<P>
At just past 12:40, Railey drove into his driveway and found his wife. 
</P>
<P>
There was no sign of a struggle. There was no skin under her fingernails
to 
indicate that she had either fought her assailant or scratched herself
when 
grasping at whatever was pulled around her throat. 
</P>
<P>
Railey said he determined that the children were safe and notified
police. 
</P>
<P>
"Dallas Emergency, Ms. . . ," the dispatcher answered. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Walker Railey," he interrupted. "Send the paramedics and
police, 
please." 
</P>
<P>
An ambulance arrived, along with neighbors. Inside the house, both
children 
were in the living room, Megan watching a silent television screen and
Ryan 
staring blankly ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Months later, Kinne told a reporter he thought it possible that Ryan
witnessed 
the attack, but he said the youngster gave investigators inconsistent
accounts 
of what might have happened that night. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe Daddy did it," the boy told investigators once. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors transferred Peggy Railey, her body alive but her brain barely 
functioning, from a Dallas hospital to a nursing home in east Texas so
she 
could be near her parents. 
</P>
<P>
Bill and Billie Jo Nicolai live in Tyler, but they had spent almost all
day 
every day in Dallas, about 60 miles away, attending to Peggy's needs.
Though a 
full-service hospital was no longer required, she remained in a
vegetative 
state from which she might never awaken. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Dallas, no sign was posted, but the Raileys' home was quietly
put on 
the market and sold. 
</P>
<P>
Walker Railey voluntarily surrendered his credentials as a minister in
the 
United Methodist Church, and then surrendered control of his wife's
legal 
affairs to her parents. He granted temporary custody of his children to
the 
friends who had kept them since April 22, John and Diane Yarrington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mother Assumed Guardianship 
</P>
<P>
Billie Jo Nicolai requested that a court grant her guardianship of her 
daughter, and Railey waived his right to continue in that traditionally
spousal 
role. 
</P>
<P>
And then, after the stunning developments and disclosures of
mid-November, 
Railey vanished. 
</P>
<P>
"I know he has some job prospects," Yarrington said. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next few months, Railey and Dallas reporters played a game of 
hide-and-seek. 
</P>
<P>
In early December, Railey told religion reporter Helen Parmley of the
Dallas 
Morning News in a telephone interview from California that he fled
despair, not 
speculation. And he maintained that he was not abandoning his children. 
</P>
<P>
"In this case, while I am relocating, looking for work, financially
strapped, 
not knowing where I'm going to end up or what I'm going to be doing,
everybody 
involved in this drama believes . . . the most stable, loving, Christian 
environment they can be in is where they are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But before anybody could get themselves too lathered up over Railey's
plight, 
Dallas Times Herald columnist Laura Miller put a new slant on the case
by 
telling a tale of the anger and indignation of Peggy Railey's family --
her 
father and her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
Both believe Railey was behind the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The motive? "A divorced man doesn't get to be bishop," said the
grandmother, 
Ella Renfro. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Wright, a contributing editor at Texas Monthly magazine, grew up
in the 
First United Methodist Church in Dallas. His childhood pastor was Robert 
Goodrich Jr., Lucy Papillon's father. 
</P>
<P>
He left the church once in disenchantment but had been drawn back by
Railey's 
socially contemporary ministry. Then he had seen the devastation at
First 
Methodist after the attack on Peggy, Walker's suicide attempt and the 
minister's affair with Lucy. 
</P>
<P>
So Wright was less a journalist than a confused and angry member of the 
congregation when he confronted Railey. 
</P>
<P>
Did Peggy know about his affair with Lucy? 
</P>
<P>
"We -- that never came up," Railey stammered. 
</P>
<P>
She didn't know? 
</P>
<P>
"I can only say it never emerged." 
</P>
<P>
Did she suspect? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no way of knowing, regarding that, that she suspected at all,
about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Changing the subject, Railey revealed he had slipped into the First
Methodist 
sanctuary to attend funeral services for a family friend. Some of his
former 
parishioners avoided him but most embraced him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Could Feel Pain' 
</P>
<P>
"They could feel my pain," Railey said, crying. He said he also felt
love. 
</P>
<P>
Did you feel a sense of shame, Wright asked. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt a great need to be forgiven, if that's what you're talking
about." 
</P>
<P>
Wright decided that was as much of a concession as he was likely to get.
But 
before departing, he said he could not construct an innocent man out of 
Railey's behavior. The journalist recounted Railey's misleading
testimony to 
the police, his avoidance of the grand jury and his inexplicable actions
on the 
night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'I Think You Are Guilty' 
</P>
<P>
"I think you are a guilty person," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear what you're saying," Railey replied. 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not know what to think. Railey failed to absorb his blunt 
accusation, choosing instead to analyze it with detachment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm aware that nobody can sit down with all the facts that are
supposedly 
known . . . and just make it all fit. That's a frustration that everyone
has 
felt, including me," Railey said. 
</P>
<P>
"Confess," Wright urged him. "It will haunt you forever, it will drive
you 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if that's a word of advice, a backhand comfort or what,"
Railey 
said. "I'm not guilty. I didn't do it. I don't feel tormented by the
guilt of 
what I didn't do." 
</P>
<P>
On Feb. 2, Billie Jo Nicolai filed a legal bombshell in civil court,
accusing 
Railey of "maliciously" attempting to kill his wife and orchestrating a
"clumsy 
attempt" to cover his actions with a phony alibi. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit sought damages for "physical and mental pain, disfigurement, 
anguish and physical impairment" on behalf of Mrs. Nicolai's comatose
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Concern over the cost of Peggy Railey's medical expenses was the
overriding 
reason for the action, but the family's decision was also emotional,
said 
Billie Jo Nicolai's attorney, Bill Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'They Are Bitter' 
</P>
<P>
"They are bitter," he said. "They are angry." 
</P>
<P>
Ted Nicolai, Peggy's younger brother, revealed that Railey had visited
his wife 
no more than three times and that after a Christmas visit with his two 
children, Ryan had suffered severe emotional problems. 
</P>
<P>
Kinne, Dallas' chief prosecutor, had sent an investigator to question
Ryan 
about the night of April 21, and the youngster talked freely about
almost 
everything. But whenever the investigator asked about the attack, Ryan
would 
tune her out. He would turn his back and try to leave the room. 
</P>
<P>
Railey moved to California, to a Victorian flat not far from San
Francisco Bay. 
The rent reportedly was $1,600, and both he and Papillon signed the
lease. 
</P>
<P>
Initial attempts to serve Railey with legal notice of the Nicolai civil
suit 
were unsuccessful. Eventually, he was spotted at a hotel, and papers
were 
slapped under the windshield wiper of a car driven by Papillon, with
Railey 
apparently slumped down inside. 
</P>
<P>
Precisely one year after the events of April, 1987, a state district
judge 
ruled that Walker Railey "intentionally, knowingly, maliciously and
brutally 
attempted to strangle his wife" and cover up his actions with a "false
alibi." 
</P>
<P>
Judge John Whittington issued a preliminary civil judgment on April 22,
1988, 
holding Railey financially liable for the injuries to his wife. The
extent of 
damages would be determined later by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling, although significant, had no bearing on the criminal
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Whittington's action came after Railey failed to respond to legal
notices of 
the suit. The judge said Railey, by his technical default, had admitted
all the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fled Bay Area 
</P>
<P>
Railey could no longer be found. Under siege from the media, he broke
the lease 
on the San Francisco "love nest" he shared with Papillon on her visits
from 
Dallas. It appeared he had fled the Bay Area altogether. 
</P>
<P>
"The court can issue a subpoena that compels him to come answer my
questions," 
Arnold said. "But today, I have less of an idea where he is than at any
time 
since this case started." 
</P>
<P>
In June, doctors reported a slight improvement in Peggy Railey's
condition and 
she was returned to Dallas and placed in the Baylor Institute for 
Rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. William Parker, the institute's medical director, said she could
turn her 
head and hear, but could not process what she heard. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish anything that seems to stimulate a response that
could be 
interpreted as functional, then we would continue to try, through
repetition, 
to improve on that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Condition Downgraded 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he didn't think his team of specialists would be able to
determine 
whether Peggy Railey would ever communicate again. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the odds are probably going to be against it, but time is the
only 
thing that's going to tell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
After more than a year in a vegetative state, doctors downgraded her
condition 
to a "persistent vegetative state," meaning, as a neurosurgeon
explained, that 
her chances for recovery were "nil." 
</P>
<P>
After two months in Dallas, she was quietly returned to the nursing home
in 
Tyler where her parents resumed their tender, but apparently hopeless,
daily 
care. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Kinne sat puffing his pipe in the district attorney's office and 
reflecting on the Railey case, his opinions no less candid than when he
first 
viewed the terrible pictures of Peggy Railey's wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This guy's a liar," Kinne said. "He's trying to cover his tracks. He
wasn't 
where he was at the time he says he was. Now the question is, if he
wasn't 
there, where was he? 
</P>
<P>
"The conclusion that everybody's drawn is that he was home choking out
his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
"But that doesn't necessarily follow. There's no proof he was at the
scene at 
the time she was strangled. There's no evidence that he strangled her or
that 
he knew who strangled her or that he arranged or participated in any
way." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Concrete Evidence 
</P>
<P>
That's not to say Kinne didn't think about prosecuting Walker Railey. He 
visualized presenting all the evidence that showed Railey lied, that he 
contrived an alibi and that he told no one of visiting his girlfriend
that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
But with a defense move for an instructed verdict of innocent, the judge
might 
ask, "Where is the evidence that he choked his wife?" Kinne said. 
</P>
<P>
The trial would probably be over before it began. 
</P>
<P>
As 1988 drew to an end, Kinne had not surrendered hope that the case
might 
someday be solved, but any possibility was a long shot. Peggy Railey
might 
miraculously recover and identify her assailant, or even young Ryan
Railey 
might have seen something and be able to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Nothing Incriminating 
</P>
<P>
Lucy Papillon might eventually shed light on the case, but Kinne once
pointed 
out that she had said nothing incriminating "since we don't have
adultery laws 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
For Kinne, Walker Railey remained the ultimate enigma. 
</P>
<P>
"The last thing you'd expect from a guy like him would be to give up his
wife 
and kids and flit off to California. Just say to hell with it and take
off. 
It's just not what you'd expect from a man of his stature. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives every indication of guilt, whether he is guilty or not." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Railey Didn't Show 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 5, Judge Whittington heard testimony in a one-day trial to
determine if 
Walker Railey should pay damages to the Nicolai family. Railey didn't
show up. 
</P>
<P>
The family was awarded $16 million -- half to cover Peggy's care, half
to 
punish Railey. It was a ruling more of symbolism than substance, a
hollow 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
Arnold said he didn't know where Railey was, or how much money he had.
He 
doubted that his wife's family would ever collect the $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
On videotape, the court watched therapists treating Peggy Railey, who
has 
virtually no body control and a haunting, lifeless look in her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Still, her sister-in-law, Linda Nicolai, told of an experience at the
hospital 
one day that suggested the depth of Peggy Railey's anguish. 
</P>
<P>
As Peggy's wheelchair went down the hall, she passed a man exercising
with a 
cord similar to what police believe was used to choke Peggy. 
</P>
<P>
Peggy Railey began sweating, hyperventilating and rubbing her arms
together. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Nicolai added: 
</P>
<P>
"She kept looking at me . . . with this wild look on her face and trying
to 
tell me something."

The Queen of England rewarded 907 people, from a beekeeper to a banker
to 
ex-Trade and Industry Minister Leon Brittan, with titles or medals in
her 
traditional New Year's honors list. Brittan, who resigned after leaking
a 
secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II,
as was 
sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the 
recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, were
newly 
dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp;
Sons and 
a member of the well-known banking family's British branch, and British 
Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the
Order of 
the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for 
portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among
several 
athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who
became a 
Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized.

 -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year's Eve
appearance in 
Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his
wife, 
Nuffie. "I wish everyone a Happy New Year," she quoted the "prince of
hi-de-ho" 
as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center. 
Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since
emergency 
surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse
Dec. 21 
during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81,
"thanks 
everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and
he

 -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J.,
retiring 
Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in
Congress. He 
recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired
voted 
articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974,
saying he 
went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79,
pointed 
proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his 
brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King

Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state's first

KEEPING PETRODOLLARS AT HOME; 
</P>
<P>
SAUDIS MAKING EFFORT TO BOOST REGIONAL TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Saudis, fewer petrodollars in their pockets and worried about
security and 
culture shock, have started looking for holidays at home and finding
that there 
is more to the country than sand. 
</P>
<P>
In the oil price heyday of the 1970s, Saudi Muslims flocked to the
kingdom's 
air terminals to escape the heat and monotony of the desert for the
great 
tourist capitals -- Paris, London, New York and Los Angeles, the French
and 
Spanish Rivieras, Istanbul and Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
But local tourism has been on the rise for the last five years,
spearheaded by 
a government campaign to encourage Saudis to spend their vacation
dollars at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a lot of religiously conservative families who suffer
when 
they go abroad," said Ibrahim al Sayed, director general of tourism
development 
in the country's mountainous southwest Asir region. "They don't want
their 
teen-agers to copy Westerners." 
</P>
<P>
He added that many Saudis are also acutely aware that language and
cultural 
barriers make them attractive victims for con artists abroad. 
</P>
<P>
"I've traveled in Europe and I've faced some of the troubles," said Fahd
al 
Sayejh, public relations manager at the Riyadh Intercontinental Hotel.
"My 
family's now looking for a villa in Abha (in the cooler Asir region).
There are 
many people who spend their summers there who used to go to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's beautiful. It reminds us of the old days when we used to go to
Lebanon 
every summer. The mountains are the same," he added. "(But) in the oil
boom 
years, businessmen thought nothing of driving to the airport and
boarding any 
available international flight. Now people are more aware of spending
their 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Tourism within Saudi Arabia may seem like a hard sell, given the
country's 
reputation as a "desert kingdom," lacking much in the way of amusement. 
</P>
<P>
But beaches along the country's eastern border on the Persian Gulf draw
big 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
Jidda on the Red Sea attracts scuba-diving enthusiasts and Najran, close
to 
Yemen, offers unusual architecture. For a change of scenery, many
tourists try 
the southwest. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole southwest area is very popular," said Antoni Kuhnen, who runs
the 
Al-Baha Motel in that region. Kuhnen estimates that the motel, opened in
1985, 
now books around 20,000 tourists a year. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha, Saudi Arabia's smallest province, is situated between Taif,
where the 
government retreats into the mountains for the summer months, and Abha,
capital 
of Asir province, which boasts 1,736 square miles of national park. 
</P>
<P>
A local newspaper noted that "visitors to the Abha region reached an 
unprecedented number, to the extent that the real estate offices in Abha
cannot 
cope with the great demand for furnished and unfurnished flats." 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 800,000 visitors were reported to have made it despite a 
relatively small airport. 
</P>
<P>
The recent popularity of in-country tourism is due largely to the
government. 
Five years ago, the few tourists who came to this region had to either
camp out 
or rely on the kindness of strangers for accommodation. 
</P>
<P>
Now, there are five hotels in the area, some of them bankrolled by the
Finance 
Ministry. Private businessmen are also being encouraged to invest in
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
An amusement park would make the area more attractive to Saudi families
who 
generally have large numbers of children to entertain, he said. Land has 
already been allocated, but awaits an investor. 
</P>
<P>
Al-Baha does not lack scenic beauty. At nearly 10,000 feet above sea
level, the 
air is cool, crisp, and a bit damp -- a welcome change from just about
anyplace 
else in the kingdom during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
The mountains, rough, craggy, and dotted with scrubby green plants, rise 
dramatically out of the Tihama Valley and are populated by shepherds
tending 
flocks of sheep and goats. Baboons lope down the mountainside, carrying
scraps 
of food fed to them by motel staff and early rising guests. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the facilities are there, the tourists will come," said
Kuhnen, who 
nonetheless believes the region suffers for lack of recreational
diversions.

(about $13) 
-- not bad for a day's work, but nothing like the old times. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a boy, we'd fish for half the time we do now and catch twice
as 
much," said Tavares, who is 40 but whose weather-beaten face looks years
older. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to come to port with the boat weighing low in the water from
all the 
fish," Tavares said during a recent visit. 
</P>
<P>
Tavares is one of thousands of men on Brazil's northeast coast who for
years 
have been fishing on jangadas, or small wooden rafts, but who now see
their 
livelihood disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
Overfishing by big commercial trawlers and a boom in the shrimp trade,
which 
kills tons of fish, have been cutting into their catch and forcing many
to seek 
steadier work on trawlers. 
</P>
<P>
About 200 jangadas now sail out of Fortaleza Harbor, where 20 years ago
there 
were about double that number, said Wilson Goncalves, president of the
local 
fishermen's union in this city of 1.3 million people. 
</P>
<P>
Work is risky on a jangada, not much bigger than a double bed and
powered only 
by the wind, and the fishing season lasts only six months a year, as the
sea is 
too stormy in winter. 
</P>
<P>
But jangadeiros, as the fishermen are known, cling to tradition. 
</P>
<P>
They refuse the usual equipment for commercial fishing like motors, nets
and 
compasses, relying entirely on hook and line and a knowledge passed down
from 
generations of how to find the fish. 
</P>
<P>
Most are illiterate and, since their early teens, have never changed
their 
routine of sailing out to sea before dawn and returning before sunset. 
</P>
<P>
They bring most of their catch home to their families and sell the rest
to tide 
them over during the winter months. 
</P>
<P>
"The jangadeiro does not understand or want technology. He's a
subsistence 
fishermen who will rely on custom until the day he dies," said
Goncalves. 
</P>
<P>
Custom has well-served Tavares and other jangadeiros for generations. 
</P>
<P>
He can tell by the color of the water which fish will be most plentiful
in a 
certain area. Darker, deeper water suggests the presence of mackerel,
grouper 
and -- if it's a lucky day -- shark. 
</P>
<P>
A green hue often means a coral reef lies below, and that means the
moray eel, 
which will bring Tavares a high price because of its tasty meat and
because 
trawlers using nets rarely snare them. 
</P>
<P>
Using the weather, ocean currents and even the phases of the moon as his 
guides, he says, he can almost always find the kind of fish he is
seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself.
The sea 
is always changing," he said as he cast his line in a place that he
thought 
would yield red snapper, a small, ruddy fish. Within half an hour, he
had 
caught five. 
</P>
<P>
But the 20th Century is closing in on the jangadeiros, who bitterly
resent the 
commercial trawlers they say are emptying their waters of fish. 
</P>
<P>
"So many fish in the ocean, and our share is so small after the fishing
boats 
come through," said Francisco dos Reis, who often joins Tavares on his
craft. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to be able to fill that basket with fish. Now we're lucky if we
can 
fill it halfway after a whole day at sea," Dos Reis said. 
</P>
<P>
One reason for the drop in their catch is the boom in Fortaleza's shrimp 
industry, which exports heavily to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
When shrimp fishermen haul in their nets, they king. 
</P>
<P>
"My father taught me most of it, but some of it I had to learn myself.
The sea 
is board 
because, unlike the shrimp, fish won't bring in coveted export dollars.

FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON'S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS
TO SYRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
WADI KHALED, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living
by 
tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel
as if 
they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical
mishap 
that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been "under
study" 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 years ago, the tribes' fear of officials drove the people
to hide 
in the woods. They missed Lebanon's only official census, conducted in
1932 
when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has
been 
carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is
still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or 
ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for
envoys of 
the Ottoman Empire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be
drafted 
into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not
understand that 
we were not under Ottoman rule anymore," said Abu Mustapha. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all
foreigners 
living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a
"citizenship under 
study" category. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special
travel 
document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost
nowhere. 
Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for
brief 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become prisoners in our own land," said Sweid. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove
out the 
Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin
to what 
is now Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then
they 
turned to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country
that 
believes in free trade (Lebanon)," said Bashir Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the
Nahr 
el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios,
videos, 
fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material,
clothes and 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Wadi Khaled's marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families,
with 
prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars
at the 
rate of 46 to a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their
country. 
Everything they do not have they buy here," said Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its
standard 
of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital,
Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no
furniture. 
They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each
family in 
the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to
the 
national minimum wage of $30 per month. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case
with 
all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943,
but to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have
resisted 
naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance
in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians," said a
Ghannam 
tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a
meal 
of lamb and rice. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which
one do we 
turn to?"

AT $80 PER MUSHROOM, PRICE FOR MATSUTAKE IS HIGH EVEN FOR THE JAPANESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the land of $7 apples and $6 boxes of granola, matsutake mushrooms
are in a 
class of their own. 
</P>
<P>
Japanese drop their usual tones of careful politeness and become
positively 
rapturous in describing these unassuming brown fungi, their woodsy taste
and 
piney smell. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of one of the world's most exclusive restaurants, Kicho, where
meals 
can run $800 a person and only an introduction from a previous customer
can win 
a reservation, recently wrote: "In autumn we can almost not do our
business 
without matsutake." 
</P>
<P>
But for the uninitiated, it is the price tag of the matsutake, or
pine-tree 
mushrooms, that is so breathtaking: a few inches high and, in fact,
rather 
mushroom-like in appearance, a single well-shaped matsutake can cost as
much as 
$80; even an average one will run $40 per stem. 
</P>
<P>
Matsutake are so pricey and so prized that matsutake fraud has now
entered the 
Japanese lexicon. Recently it was discovered that some of these
mushrooms were 
being sold with tiny lead slivers inserted in their stems to inflate
their 
weight and thus their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Worth It to Japanese 
</P>
<P>
For the Japanese, who adore all manner of mushrooms and use about half a
dozen 
different varieties in their everyday food, the price is clearly worth
it. "I 
love them," a Japanese newspaper editor said recently, as he dropped the 
subject at hand -- stock market manipulation -- to wax eloquent about 
matsutake. 
</P>
<P>
A Japanese folk saying sums up the emotionalism toward matsutake: "The
mountain 
where you picked matsutake cannot be forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
With this saying in mind, a farming community troubled by a high rate of 
bachelorhood among its young men recently held a matsutake-picking party
in an 
effort to entice women back to the farm. 
</P>
<P>
According to mushroom connoisseurs, matsutake are expensive because
their 
season is short -- just a few weeks in late fall -- and because they can
grow 
only in the wild. Japan's wilderness has been disappearing steadily in
the face 
of relentless urbanization, and the red pine trees around which
matsutake 
flourish have also been diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Domesticated Yet 
</P>
<P>
The finest scientists have failed so far to domesticate the matsutake on
a mass 
scale, despite repeated efforts. Mie Ogoshi of Japan's Tsuji Cooking
School 
said that matsutake were much more common and much cheaper 20 years ago
and 
were used liberally in the kitchen. Now, however, they are rationed 
parsimoniously: paper-thin slices in a special broth, a few bits mixed
in a 
rice dish or a few grilled with a touch of lime and soy sauce. One
special soup 
features a little matsutake with a touch of real gold shavings. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for matsutake is so strong that the import-resistant Japanese
have 
turned to South Korea and China, where matsutake also grow and cost much
less. 
</P>
<P>
Mushroom aficionados insist that these imports do not taste as good as
local 
ones; among other drawbacks, to satisfy customs inspectors the matsutake
must 
be washed well, which attenuates their aroma, they say. Nonetheless,
every 
fall, die-hard matsutake lovers figure that it is worth the price of a 
Tokyo-Seoul round-trip ticket (about $500) to fill a few boxes with
fresh 
Korean matsutake and lovingly carry them home. 
</P>
<P>
Still, even in affluent Japan, there are many who find $80 per mushroom
a bit 
rich for the blood. One Japanese woman who raved about the taste and
autumnal 
smell of matsutake admitted, after calming down, that she had not bought
one in 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like They Are Gold' 
</P>
<P>
"When you look at the price tag on the matsutake, it is like they are
gold," 
acknowledged Ogoshi, of the cooking school. And like many high-priced
foods in 
Japan, including the beautiful cantaloupe grown here and sold,
individually 
wrapped, for $80 or more, matsutake most often are given as presents. 
</P>
<P>
For those who love their matsutake but cannot afford them, one
enterprising 
Japanese company recently developed "essence of matsutake," a small vial
of 
which costs only $2.50. The liquid can be poured on top of the lowly
shiitake 
or ma-shu-ru-mu (white American-style mushroom), allowing the diner to
imagine 
it is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
For the truly desperate, stores sell a few slices of matsutake for the 
comparatively reasonable price of $20. When sniffed very closely they do
give 
off a piney odor. Cooked -- one minute in a hot broiler or over a fire,
with 
drop of a little lime juice -- they taste, well, like a mushroom.

WESTERN OFFICIALS LOOK TO AFGHANISTAN AND SEE A NEW PROBLEM -- HEROIN

SAFED KOH REGION, Afghanistan 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In northeastern Afghanistan, small numbers of returned refugees have
been 
rebuilding their homes and replanting their terraced fields. 
</P>
<P>
But not all the fields returned to the plow in the last year have been
planted 
with wheat and corn. Many -- perhaps one out of every two -- were turned
over 
to the cultivation of marijuana and opium-producing poppies. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, many Western narcotics control officials, diplomats, some
members of 
the Afghan resistance, and Pakistani officials, are concerned that this
region 
could develop into the world's leading producer of heroin -- the potent
drug 
derived from opium. 
</P>
<P>
The primary source of opium for the West remains Southeast Asia's
"Golden 
Triangle" -- Burma, Laos, and Thailand. But since the mid-1980s,
international 
narcotics control sources say, the "Golden Crescent" of Southwest Asia
has 
gained prominence. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
30% of Market 
</P>
<P>
Together, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran account for at least 30% of
the 
United States heroin market, these sources estimate. 
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan, according to narcotics officials, is the region's largest 
producer. Last year's opium crop is estimated at between 500 and 700
tons. The 
1988-89 poppy season, which normally begins with the first rains in
December, 
is expected to increase output by 100 to 200 tons. The reasons for 
Afghanistan's increased production include: lack of government control
in much 
of the countryside during the nine-year war against Soviet occupation; 
crackdowns on cultivation in Pakistan, which have made Afghanistan a
safer 
production center; Tehran's apparent willingness to allow trafficking
through 
Iran; and growing demand in neighboring Pakistan and the West. 
</P>
<P>
For many peasants, white-and-pink poppy flowers are the easiest and most 
lucrative cash crop. Harvesting the sticky, black sap can bring a small
farmer 
up to $2,000 -- a fortune in this area. Dealers take the opium by horse
and 
mule across the border into Pakistan's tribal border districts; there,
scores 
of illicit laboratories process the opium into heroin. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Difficult to Control 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have to be Adam Smith to realize we have a problem," says
Carlo 
Boccia, a representative of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in
Paris. 
"When drugs become more readily available, they become more difficult to 
control." 
</P>
<P>
Western narcotics officials say they do not know how much of Iran's 
"tremendous" poppy production reaches the international market. Pakistan
is 
believed to have produced 200 or more tons of opium last year. Most of
the 
region's heroin is manufactured in Pakistani labs. (Ten pounds of opium
produce 
about one pound of pure heroin, which can sell for tens of thousands to
a few 
hundred thousand dollars in the West. Heroin sold in the West is
diluted, about 
5% pure.) 
</P>
<P>
One of the most severe effects of this rapidly growing regional trade,
Western 
aid officials and other sources say, is its corrupting and undermining 
influence on Pakistani and Afghan society. They cite: 
</P>
<P>
* A rise in the number of Pakistani addicts, most of whom "chase the
* drag-on" 
(smoke heroin), from an estimated 200,000 in the early 1980s to between
1 
million to 3 million today. 
</P>
<P>
* The spread of heroin abuse among Pakistan's 3 million Afghan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
* Corruption that involves senior Pakistan government officials, Army
* officers, 
politicians, refugee administrators, businessmen, tribal leaders, and
members 
of the Afghan resistance. This was alleged separately by narcotics and 
intelligence officials, and Western aid sources. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gang Warfare Feared 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are fears that the "drug and gun culture" on both
sides of 
the border could increase gang warfare. "You have got to understand that
it is 
a huge business in this part of the world. There are terrible things
going on, 
and they involve a lot of people," says a worried representative of the
Afghan 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's new prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, has described illegal
drugs as 
the country's "No. 1 problem" and has created a Ministry of Narcotics to
tackle 
it. Diplomats and aid workers are skeptical about chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
"The only reason we have not yet seen the sort of violence you find in
Colombia 
(South America) is that enough people here are getting paid off to keep
the 
trade going," a Western aid official says. "The moment you start hitting
where 
it hurts, the situation will start getting nasty." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Route Through Karachi 
</P>
<P>
Narcotics from eastern and northern Afghanistan and Pakistan's border
areas are 
channeled to Karachi; those from southern Afghanistan go toward Iran. 
</P>
<P>
According to aid sources, trucks from the government-run National
Logistics 
Corporation, which normally carry goods to Afghan refugee camps, often
take 
heroin to Karachi. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of direct collaboration with the police, the Army, and
the 
refugee administration," says a Western official. 
</P>
<P>
For appearances, sources say, a vehicle is sometimes deliberately
sacrificed to 
the police. The rest then proceed unhindered to Karachi, where the
heroin is 
taken by boat or plane to the Mideast and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Berlin an Entry Point 
</P>
<P>
Some sources allege that officials in Pakistan's National Shipping
Company are 
involved. Narcotics officials say East Berlin, a drugs gateway in the
1970s, is 
once again becoming a major entry point. 
</P>
<P>
The production of opium in southwest Afghanistan has come under the
control of 
local drug lords, cooperating closely with Pakistani traffickers as well
as 
drug syndicates from Europe and North America, intelligence sources say. 
</P>
<P>
At Musa Qala, a fertile region in southern Afghanistan, poppy growing is 
largely run by Nassim Akhun Zada, say journalists and relief workers who
have 
visited the area. Zada is a guerrilla commander, reportedly still
affiliated 
with an Afghan resistance party, the Harakat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami, but who 
operates largely on his own. Western sources say Zada leads a private
army of 
1,200 fighters. Recently, there have been reports of pitched battles
with a 
rival, Abdul Rahman Khan of the Hizb-i-Islami resistance party. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Government Role Seen 
</P>
<P>
From Musa Qala, part of the opium harvest is transported to eastern
Iran. But 
most is taken to the Pakistani desert refugee camps at Gerde-Jangal.
There, 
resistance and aid sources say, trafficking is carried out in
collaboration 
with officers of Pakistan's Interservices Intelligence (ISI)
organization. 
</P>
<P>
At Gerde-Jangal, the opium is weighed and some is processed by local
labs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much dealing going on that the money is not counted but
weighed," 
a Western aid representative says. Various sources, including a former 
trafficker from Quetta, say narcotics are driven in five-vehicle convoys
-- two 
carrying drugs, the other three armed guards and heavy machine guns --
through 
government checkpoints, to Robat. 
</P>
<P>
Robat is believed to have 20 or more heroin labs, from which the drug is
driven 
in armed convoys across southern Iran to Turkey and on to Europe and
America. 
</P>
<P>
Sources say the Robat operations involve members of at least three
Afghan 
resistance parties. It is uncertain whether party officials in Quetta
and 
Peshawar are linked to the trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are forbidden to enter Robat "for security reasons." Some
sources 
claim that the aim is to prevent outsiders from witnessing what goes on. 
</P>
<P>
"It is perfectly obvious that this trafficking could not proceed without
the 
full knowledge of the ISI (Interservices Intelligence) and the local
Pakistani 
authorities," a West European diplomat says.

A SAD BUT GROWING PHENOMENON;

CHINA COPES WITH ITS UNWANTED BABIES

Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a
grapefruit on 
her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the 
well-equiped Beijing Children's Welfare Institute. But many of the
thousands of 
unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside 
hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect
to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a
result 
of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have
loosened, 
China's rural population has become more mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically
handicapped 
babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the
right 
medical care and treatment is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes, Money Attached 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but
never 
with the parents' address," said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing
Children 
Welfare Institute, the city's only state-run orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at
Beijing's 
capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers
are 
left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700
foundlings were 
picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the
province's 
counties showed that 862 babies were picked up. 
</P>

The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down's Syndrome,
broken 
backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as
harelips. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
'Many Never Survive' 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater
than is 
being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone.
"Most of 
them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted
burden," 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25
vagrants had 
been found dead at Beijing's railway station. The issue is highly
sensitive and 
public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted 
babies, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Ye denied a People's Daily report that his institute received 141
handicapped 
foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have
issued a 
circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a
child, an 
act that contravenes the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewards Offered 
</P>
<P>
Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the
foundlings. 
Only 1.8% of the country's 10 million disabled children receive special
care in 
child welfare institutions set up in the country's urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can
provide 
reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in
urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in
return 
for financial donations. At the Tianjin children's welfare institute,
officials 
say that what was originally designed for orphans has become "an
abandoned 
babies" collecting house. 
</P>
<P>
"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped
but they 
had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn't they
send these 
children to hospital?" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People's
Daily. 
Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children's institute says
it can 
no longer afford to pay for so many children's medical fees.

PRIEST'S OUSTER SILENCES HAITI'S VOICE OF THE POOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has
silenced 
Haiti's most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian
Order 
accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare,
calling 
him a "protagonist of destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although
Aristide 
remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over
church 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been neutralized," said sociologist Franklyn Midi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Campaigner 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most
outspoken 
campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 
184-year existence by dictators. 
</P>
<P>
He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11
attack 
at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs
armed with 
machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least
70 
others. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy
in a 
coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they
wanted 
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the
church 
massacre as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order
to 
leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Protests 
</P>
<P>
Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. 
Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October,
but 
there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church
massacre, has 
made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But
friends 
say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses
in 
Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's political 
proselytizing of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement
in a 
political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide
preaches 
"active nonviolence." He urges a "real revolution" to bring democracy to
Haiti, 
but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Brimstone 
</P>
<P>
His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading 
questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were 
broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the
urban poor 
and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their
"prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's crusade,
the 
church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of
radicalizing 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief,"
Midi 
said of Aristide's ouster. "They are uncomfortable when the voice of the
poor 
is raised too high." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the
resentment of 
the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form," Midi added. "He
has not 
sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops Were Worried 
</P>
<P>
A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of
America 
that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian "bishops worried about
the 
results of Aristide's action." 
</P>
<P>
But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that
the 
council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to
tighten 
army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the 
government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the
most 
progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress
in 
bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Become a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide's
ouster; but 
to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that
soldiers 
faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the
army," 
said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those
who 
participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and
justice are 
penalized and punished," he said.

psychological 
imbalance and tempts men." 
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like 
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of
shorts and 
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with
chadors. 
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said
Selma, 
a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural
center where 
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman 
amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage
political 
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death
to 
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in
Lebanon's 
sectarian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many
Lebanese, 
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double 
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is
believed to 
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners
missing in 
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject,"
said 
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious
center, 
in Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on
by 
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl
of her 
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in
the 
name of religion. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered 
respectable and far from promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of
the 54 
million population is Shia. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it 
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last
"for an 
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born
after the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's
economic 
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it,
they 
have physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage
provides 
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly." 
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should
preferably 
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek
it. 
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical
music 
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser
said. 
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved thatr the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especiallbanon, where the government has
collapsed, the Shias 
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of
our 
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free
medical 
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas." 
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit,
as well 
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near
future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to
provide 
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military
or 
political importance." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs,
Mousavi 
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say
we've 
raided houses where people gamble or drink." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There
were 
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing
aberrant 
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."

COLOMBIA'S EMERALD MINES: GREEN GOLD

BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the
biggest 
emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital
over a 
potholed track takes eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land
is a 
lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild
mountain 
peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if
nature 
seeks to hide its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of
pesos to 
be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for
the 
simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and
fortunes 
are squandered in the town's bars and dives. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but
during an 
emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered --
the 
population soars to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Issued 
</P>
<P>
For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone
can be 
extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been
dubbed 
the "Land of 1,001 Nights" and the "Devil's Caldron." 
</P>
<P>
Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where 
millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have
lost their 
lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by
the 
roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite
and 
granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious
stone and 
is green or blue-green in color. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable are the so-called 'oil drops' and 'water eyes,'
veritable 
masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid," explained a
jeweler in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to
be 
valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and
the 
Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Resources 
</P>
<P>
The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present 
official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the
concession 
from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year
is 
difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear
onto 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3
million. 
However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million
worth of 
Colombian emeralds are marketed each year. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing
supply 
and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective
purchasers are 
advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a
respected 
jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for
the 
experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead
of a 
valuable gem.

WOMAN DIES TRYING TO GET INTO HOME VIA WINDOW

A neighbor saw what he thought was a department store mannequin hanging
upside 
down from the window of the house next door and ignored it. It turned
out to be 
a woman who died of exposure while trying to break into her home. 
</P>
<P>
The body of Sherry Gaydos, 34, clad only in her underwear and socks, was
found 
Wednesday by the neighbor, hanging upside down with her left leg wedged
in a 
pantry window at her home. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos' husband, John, was asleep inside the house when the incident
occurred, 
unaware of his wife's struggle for life, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"It took two policemen to pry the window off her foot," John Gaydos
said. "She 
hung upside down by her ankle and froze to death." 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife left home while he slept Tuesday evening and drove
the car 
to the end of the alley, where the vehicle struck a telephone pole. 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Gaydos was taken unconscious to a Dayton hospital for treatment,
then 
was released or left on her own, her husband said. In the meantime, her
car -- 
with the keys inside -- was towed out of the alley, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police told Gaydos that their investigation showed that his wife took a
cab 
from the hospital to their home around 1 a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
With her keys gone, Sherry Gaydos apparently tried to force her way into
a 
pantry window at the rear of the building and became trapped after the
window 
closed on her foot, her husband said. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said his wife apparently had removed some of her clothes "because
she 
was trying to be thin enough to get through the small window." 
</P>
<P>
"It was very small. No human could really have gotten into it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It appeared Sherry Gaydos tried to boost herself through the window
using a 
metal garbage can. The can was tipped over beneath the window. 
</P>
<P>
Wilma Johnson, the neighbor who discovered the woman's snow-covered
body, said 
she noticed the body hanging from the window about 9 a.m. Wednesday but
thought 
it was a department store mannequin. When it still was there several
hours 
later, she investigated. 
</P>
<P>
Gaydos said he was at home while his wife was trying to enter the house,
having 
fallen asleep on the couch. He said he awoke at about 11:30 and went to
bed but 
was not aware that his wife had left. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Lett, an investigator with the Montgomery County coroner's office,
said 
the official cause of death was not determined pending toxicology tests. 
</P>
<P>
"With this type of death, a woman hanging out of the window by one leg
in her 
underclothing in severe weather, you question that kind of death," Lett
said. 
"But at this point we did not find any foul play."
